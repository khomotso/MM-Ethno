,KESSC1,July 2018,,,,,,,,"I have an older sister and a brother. My sister is about 17. And my brother is 16. They're both in a government secondary school. They say the school I'm going to is good, and better than the government school. Because some lessons cover material in grade 6 that they don't see until grade 10 in government school."
,KESSC1,July 2018,,,,,,,,"My parents listen to my ideas. Sometimes I go back home and talk about things I learned at school, and they receive it well, saying things like, 'Oh, it's like that, really?' Or if I make a mistake, they correct me. Like recently I went home and talked about the reproduction of plant and animal cells. My father told me that he only learned that kind of thing in grade 9 or 10."
,KESSC1,July 2018,,,,,,,,"I don't usually feel shy or embarrassed in class, but if I have a hard time understanding something it makes me uncomfortable. If I make a mistake, it doesn't trouble me too much. I just think that the teacher will explain it again, if I don't understand."
,KESSC1,July 2018,,,,,,,,"I have many friends who go to government school. They seem different. They just copy the teacher. They repeat by heart. They don't understand the meaning. But us, we can talk [for] ourselves. In terms of personality, I would say they are more more rude. I mean, they use bad words."
,KESSC1,July 2018,,,,,,,,"When I'm with friends, if I disagree with them about something and I'm the only one who disagrees, I'll usually just go along with the group. But sometimes for important things, I will insist."
,KESSC1,July 2018,,,,,,,,"When I really want something in life, but can't get it, it makes me upset. I don't like that kind of feeling, and wish I could change that about myself."
,KESSC1,July 2018,,,,,,,,"The last time I had a fight with another child was last year, with a Chinese student. The fight started because he was teasing me and insulted my parents."
