,KEKS-T1,Q2 2018,KEKS,Indirect A,PR,scenario,"insight, generosity","The students have taught me things about how to relate better socially. When I had good curry I’d lunch in my room, eating alone and keeping it to myself. When I didn't have good food, that was when I would eat out with the students. But the students share their food with others whether their curry is good or bad. It made me think, and I realized my selfishness."
,KEKS-T2,Q2 2018,KEKS,Indirect A,PR,story,"insight, tolerance","One day, a mother of a student came to me and said, “Teacher I felt so ashamed of myself.” I asked her why. She said that a neighbor had called on the phone to ask to borrow her car. She was breastfeeding at the time, and afterward complained aloud, “They should come in person instead of just calling. Who do they think they are?” The son saw that his mother was angry and exclaimed: “Put yourself in their place. They could be very busy. Their father might be packing. Their mother could have a stomachache. Even their grandmother could be busy. You don’t need to assume the worst, and be angry. Be kind.” The mother immediately felt shamed by her son's example."
,KEKS-T3,Q2 2018,KEKS,Indirect A,R,story,"behavior change, empathy","In our school there is a special student who has a lot of consideration for others. One day a student got sick. I thought I would take the whole class to visit him when school let out. But we were busy that day, and so couldn't make time for it. But that child went by himself. The following morning, he stood up and said, “Teacher, I want to say something.” He reported that our sick classmate looked very lonely. He said, “If we visit him he'll feel better, and that will speed his recovery.” I replied that the whole class would visit him end of the day. But the student insisted, “Why can’t we go now in the morning? We can have our class as a discussion while we're walking.” Then I thought, “Why not?”. And so we visited the sick boy in the morning. He was very happy. The following day he rejoined the class."
,KEKS-T4,Q2 2018,KEKS,Indirect A,R,scenario,"behavior change, family discussion","It's very rewarding when the children pick up on what I’m trying to teach. I get discouraged when they don't listen to me, or don't seem to get it. I feel even worse when I realize I've run out of ideas on what I can do to get through to them. At dinner my family and I will often share our experiences of the day. Sometimes I ask their opinion about some of my teaching struggles. I think this open sharing has improved communication in the family overall, because we didn't talk much before. Now conversation just flows."
,KEKS-T6,Q2 2018,KEKS,Indirect A,PR,story,"growth, sharing difficulties","The way to be one with the students is to know where they have come from. That’s what one teacher told me. So one day I decided to take the children outside to sit and talk. I took them to a riverbank away from the village. First I told them my own life. When I was young, our family was in great difficulty. Then I told them how I got through it. Then one child after another told their own life stories. We started to all feel closer. The story of one student in particular was quite significant. She said that she thought of her mother always. Her mother died when she was very young. Her father is a soldier and seldom at home. She’s staying with her aunt. This child had been quite isolated in the class, and didn't talk much with others. But after that day at the riverbank, she's really opened up, and seems to look up to me. The whole class has started to feel more like a family."
,KESS-T1,Q2 2018,KESS,Indirect A,P,story,"behavior change, confidence to speak up","I used to be so shy, and wasn't confident to speak. But I practice in front of the children, and they trust me, and it gives me the strength to speak out in front of the parents. Last year in June, at the start of the school year, we had a meeting where all the parents were invited. And my school principal asked me to say something to the parents. So I spent all night writing down how I thought the parents could be involved, and the next morning I shared stories about things between the students and me, or how they are improving, and how the parents should support it, things they could do at home. School also makes us more social."
,KESS-T1,Q2 2018,KESS,Indirect A,PRC,story,"growth, responsibility, frustration, challenging authority","I was always a good follower. Learned from the leaders. I am an assistant principal. Last December, the teachers and students wanted to have a Christmas gathering with another community school (Dima school). Our school principal wasn’t present at school at that time. As an assistant principal, I went to inform the school committee after we had discussed and had agreed plans with Dima school. The reply I got from the school committee was, ""this is not your school. You don't just get to decide these things on your own. You should have come to us first."" Within the church culture, sending an official letter from the church if having activities with another church is a protocol. But for me, this is not a church activity but the school activity. I felt I was scolded very badly. The other teachers were about to give up, but when I looked at the very excited students, and all the preparation work we were doing, like making presents and decorations, I decided to go anyway. So I went back to the school committee and confronted them, ""this is not a church activity. This is our school activity. It's even in the curriculum. Even if you don't approve, we are going.” Finally, the school committee gave permission with a warning not to do this again."
,KESS-T2,Q2 2018,KESS,Indirect A,PRC,scenario,"frustration, disillusionment","The very first year of teaching. I worked closely with two other friends. We were very happy, because the students were still very young and very obedient, and we also were still very fresh and idealistic, dreaming that we would make a big breakthrough as a people. We worked through the night together, without feeling tired. We would have to make stories, draw pictures, but were happy and excited for the students and what we were doing for them. But after that time, not so much. Now, in fact, when I come to teacher training in Kawnghka I get discouraged. I see our leaders gossiping about each other, complaining that they don't get paid as much as others even though they do more work, and things like that. The idealism is gone."
,KESS-T2,Q2 2018,KESS,Indirect A,PRC,story,"frustration, insight, challenging authority, rigid rules","I'm going to try to do peer teaching this year in grade 6. Actually, I don't want to be called teacher. I want us all to be learners, and have some of my students lead classes more often. I don't think the principal will accept this, in fact I doubt that she will, but I want to try anyway. I also want to stop all the rules and rigid discipline we still have at our school. Even if we don't beat the children, there are still all these unnecessary rules that lead us to treat the children too harshly. One day a child came to me to ask to borrow a spoon during lunch, because she forgot hers at home, so I jumped up to go get one, and the principal shouted, ""No, I already told them not to forget their spoons! She'll just have to go without. Sit back down and don't get her one."" Or to give another example, one day during assembly the children were moving around a bit while the principal was talking, and she shouted at them, ""Stand still! Hands at your sides!"" And they went all stiff like they were in prison. It made me sick. What's the point of that? They're just children. They forget things sometimes, they need to move. Who is it hurting?"
,KESS-T3,Q2 2018,KESS,Indirect A,P,story,behavior change,"I had a student who attended the government school, and he switched to our school. He was about 6 or 7, and we started him back in grade 1. At first he was very rude, he would even hit the teachers, but after about 3 or 4 months, after he got used to the daily routine, he stopped disturbing the other children, and he showed good behavior. His parents even came and said, 'Oh, he actually wants to go to school now.' It used to be hard to get him to go to school, when he was going to government school."
,KESS-T3,Q2 2018,KESS,Indirect A,P,story,"insight, growth, self expression","Usually when we (adults) were going to school as children, taking exams or something, we would always memorize things by heart. In our school we asked our students to write something as a kind of test, but we didn't call it a test. We just asked them to write about their family. So the title was, ""My family."" When I was in school I would have written, ""My father and mother are so-and-so, I have this many brothers and sisters,"" and just the facts like that. But this one student of mine wrote about the real situation in her family. ""Our toilet is broken, and my uncle just arrived from Mandalay. All the family members are working for my school fees,"" like that. She also wrote about her own inner feelings. It made me very proud."
,KESS-T3,Q2 2018,KESS,Indirect A,PR,scenario,"insight, behavior change, controlling temper, communication","When I was younger I got angry easily. I couldn't control my temper. When I felt angry I showed it immediately. In this program they provide PLD. And I was able to slowly put away that mindset. It's still a struggle sometimes, but I'm working on it. I think my communication has gotten better not only with the students, but also with other teachers, since I'm the assistant principal. Sometimes a teacher won't show up to work without informing me, for example. It used to be that I would just make some criticism in a general meeting with everyone, but now I try to talk with them privately, understand the reasons, and explain how they should do things differently even if they have good reasons."
,KESS-T3,Q2 2018,KESS,Indirect A,PC,story,"behavior change, growth, confidence","Last year we put on a science fair as part of our Christmas party. Actually, for we teachers, it seemed normal to us because of how we see these children every day. But the parents came to join us, and they were actually shocked to see how the children were good at explaining their work. They would ask the children questions, and the children answered them confidently. This amazed them. We got a lot of this kind of feedback from parents, which made me feel very happy. They never saw this kind of program in this village."
