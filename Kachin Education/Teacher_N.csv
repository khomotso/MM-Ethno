,KEKS-T1,Q2 2018,"Personal, Community",scenario,,,Weak,sharing,"The students have taught me things about how to relate better socially. When I had good curry I’d lunch in my room, eating alone and keeping it to myself. When I didn't have good food, that was when I would eat out with the students. But the students share their food with others whether their curry is good or bad. It made me think, and I realized my selfishness."
,KEKS-T2,Q2 2018,"Personal, Family",story,,,Moderate,empathy,"One day, a mother of a student came to me and said, “Teacher I felt so ashamed of myself.” I asked her why. She said that a neighbor had called on the phone to ask to borrow her car. She was breastfeeding at the time, and afterward complained aloud, “They should come in person instead of just calling. Who do they think they are?” The son saw that his mother was angry and exclaimed: “Put yourself in their place. They could be very busy. Their father might be packing. Their mother could have a stomachache. Even their grandmother could be busy. You don’t need to assume the worst, and be angry. Be kind.” The mother immediately felt shamed by her son's example."
,KEKS-T3,Q2 2018,Community,story,,,Strong,"empathy, flexibility","In our school there is a special student who has a lot of consideration for others. One day a student got sick. I thought I would take the whole class to visit him when school let out. But we were busy that day, and so couldn't make time for it. But that child went by himself. The following morning, he stood up and said, “Teacher, I want to say something.” He reported that our sick classmate looked very lonely. He said, “If we visit him he'll feel better, and that will speed his recovery.” I replied that the whole class would visit him end of the day. But the student insisted, “Why can’t we go now in the morning? We can have our class as a discussion while we're walking.” Then I thought, “Why not?”. And so we visited the sick boy in the morning. He was very happy. The following day he rejoined the class."
,KEKS-T4,Q2 2018,"Personal, Family",scenario,,,Moderate,dialogue,"It's very rewarding when the children pick up on what I’m trying to teach. I get discouraged when they don't listen to me, or don't seem to get it. I feel even worse when I realize I've run out of ideas on what I can do to get through to them. At dinner my family and I will often share our experiences of the day. Sometimes I ask their opinion about some of my teaching struggles. I think this open sharing has improved communication in the family overall, because we didn't talk much before. Now conversation just flows."
,KEKS-T6,Q2 2018,"Personal, Community",story,,,Moderate,"sharing, dialogue","The way to be one with the students is to know where they have come from. That’s what one teacher told me. So one day I decided to take the children outside to sit and talk. I took them to a riverbank away from the village. First I told them my own life. When I was young, our family was in great difficulty. Then I told them how I got through it. Then one child after another told their own life stories. We started to all feel closer. The story of one student in particular was quite significant. She said that she thought of her mother always. Her mother died when she was very young. Her father is a soldier and seldom at home. She’s staying with her aunt. This child had been quite isolated in the class, and didn't talk much with others. But after that day at the riverbank, she's really opened up, and seems to look up to me. The whole class has started to feel more like a family."
,KESS-T1,Q2 2018,"Personal, Community",story,,,Moderate,confidence,"I used to be so shy, and wasn't confident to speak. But I practice in front of the children, and they trust me, and it gives me the strength to speak out in front of the parents. Last year in June, at the start of the school year, we had a meeting where all the parents were invited. And my school principal asked me to say something to the parents. So I spent all night writing down how I thought the parents could be involved, and the next morning I shared stories about things between the students and me, or how they are improving, and how the parents should support it, things they could do at home. School also makes us more social."
,KESS-T1,Q2 2018,"Personal, Colleagues, Community",story,,,Strong,"leadership, challenging authority","I was always a good follower. Learned from the leaders. I am an assistant principal. Last December, the teachers and students wanted to have a Christmas gathering with another community school (Dima school). Our school principal wasn’t present at school at that time. As an assistant principal, I went to inform the school committee after we had discussed and had agreed plans with Dima school. The reply I got from the school committee was, ""this is not your school. You don't just get to decide these things on your own. You should have come to us first."" Within the church culture, sending an official letter from the church if having activities with another church is a protocol. But for me, this is not a church activity but the school activity. I felt I was scolded very badly. The other teachers were about to give up, but when I looked at the very excited students, and all the preparation work we were doing, like making presents and decorations, I decided to go anyway. So I went back to the school committee and confronted them, ""this is not a church activity. This is our school activity. It's even in the curriculum. Even if you don't approve, we are going.” Finally, the school committee gave permission with a warning not to do this again."
,KESS-T2,Q2 2018,"Personal, Colleagues, Community",scenario,,,Moderate,"disillusionment, intrinsic motivation","The very first year of teaching. I worked closely with two other friends. We were very happy, because the students were still very young and very obedient, and we also were still very fresh and idealistic, dreaming that we would make a big breakthrough as a people. We worked through the night together, without feeling tired. We would have to make stories, draw pictures, but were happy and excited for the students and what we were doing for them. But after that time, not so much. Now, in fact, when I come to teacher training in Kawnghka I get discouraged. I see our leaders gossiping about each other, complaining that they don't get paid as much as others even though they do more work, and things like that. The idealism is gone."
,KESS-T2,Q2 2018,"Personal, Colleagues, Community",story,,,Strong,"power sharing, challenging authority, flexibility","I'm going to try to do peer teaching this year in grade 6. Actually, I don't want to be called teacher. I want us all to be learners, and have some of my students lead classes more often. I don't think the principal will accept this, in fact I doubt that she will, but I want to try anyway. I also want to stop all the rules and rigid discipline we still have at our school. Even if we don't beat the children, there are still all these unnecessary rules that lead us to treat the children too harshly. One day a child came to me to ask to borrow a spoon during lunch, because she forgot hers at home, so I jumped up to go get one, and the principal shouted, ""No, I already told them not to forget their spoons! She'll just have to go without. Sit back down and don't get her one."" Or to give another example, one day during assembly the children were moving around a bit while the principal was talking, and she shouted at them, ""Stand still! Hands at your sides!"" And they went all stiff like they were in prison. It made me sick. What's the point of that? They're just children. They forget things sometimes, they need to move. Who is it hurting?"
,KESS-T3,Q2 2018,"Personal, Family",story,,,Moderate,"violence, rudeness","I had a student who attended the government school, and he switched to our school. He was about 6 or 7, and we started him back in grade 1. At first he was very rude, he would even hit the teachers, but after about 3 or 4 months, after he got used to the daily routine, he stopped disturbing the other children, and he showed good behavior. His parents even came and said, 'Oh, he actually wants to go to school now.' It used to be hard to get him to go to school, when he was going to government school."
,KESS-T3,Q2 2018,"Personal, Community",story,,,Strong,"self-expression, self-awareness","Usually when we (adults) were going to school as children, taking exams or something, we would always memorize things by heart. In our school we asked our students to write something as a kind of test, but we didn't call it a test. We just asked them to write about their family. So the title was, ""My family."" When I was in school I would have written, ""My father and mother are so-and-so, I have this many brothers and sisters,"" and just the facts like that. But this one student of mine wrote about the real situation in her family. ""Our toilet is broken, and my uncle just arrived from Mandalay. All the family members are working for my school fees,"" like that. She also wrote about her own inner feelings. It made me very proud."
,KESS-T3,Q2 2018,"Personal, Colleagues",scenario,,,Moderate,"self control, dialogue, blaming others","When I was younger I got angry easily. I couldn't control my temper. When I felt angry I showed it immediately. In this program they provide PLD. And I was able to slowly put away that mindset. It's still a struggle sometimes, but I'm working on it. I think my communication has gotten better not only with the students, but also with other teachers, since I'm the assistant principal. Sometimes a teacher won't show up to work without informing me, for example. It used to be that I would just make some criticism in a general meeting with everyone, but now I try to talk with them privately, understand the reasons, and explain how they should do things differently even if they have good reasons."
,KESS-T3,Q2 2018,Community,story,,,Strong,confidence,"Last year we put on a science fair as part of our Christmas party. Actually, for we teachers, it seemed normal to us because of how we see these children every day. But the parents came to join us, and they were actually shocked to see how the children were good at explaining their work. They would ask the children questions, and the children answered them confidently. This amazed them. We got a lot of this kind of feedback from parents, which made me feel very happy. They never saw this kind of program in this village."
,KESS-T4,Q3 2018,"Personal, Community",story,,,Strong,"community service, low self-esteem, nationalism","I was working as an assistant editor in a publishing house in Yangon when I first heard about this education project. Before that I was trying to work as a journalist. I earned two degrees, one from the distance education university, and one from MIT. My family had some money problems a few years before that, and so to help I went to Singapore to find work, but I could only find work as a maid, and it became clear to me that my education was worthless. I worked as a maid for 3 years, and it made me feel so awful, that I shouldn't have wasted my time with school. In 2011 I came back to Myanmar, and found work at a publishing house. I actually searched for an NGO job, but I wasn't successful. After I had been working there for 3 years, my mother told me about this school. She told me that if I came back to work at the school I could stay in her house (which was near to the school) and she would support me. Since Yangon was very expensive, this was an appealing idea. It was also the case that I didn't feel like my work was helping anyone, apart from giving me money to live. So I agreed to come back and provide a service to my people.

Around the same time there was a lot of talk in Kachin society about doing something to serve the Kachin people. But what they meant when they said that was to become a soldier and join the fight against the government. That never sat well with me. The education project showed me a way to serve the Kachin people without fighting, and so that's what I did."
,KESS-T4,Q3 2018,Community,story,,,Strong,creativity,"I was impressed with some of the grade 5 students, who tried to make a small movie with a smartphone. It actually wasn't a school project, just something they wanted to do for the fun of it. They made their own props, set their own scenes, and even had a director, then they brought to me a bunch of video clips and asked if I could edit them together on the computer to make a movie. I had to tell them no, because it was a fighting movie that had some bad language, and I didn't want to be associated with it, but I was impressed with their effort. And I told them I was proud of them."
,KESS-T4,Q3 2018,Personal,scenario,,,Strong,"self-awareness, confidence","At first I just saw myself as a teacher, but now I think I see that I can bring more value than just what I do in the classroom. That's not to say I feel confident or empowered, just that I can see how the children are affected. In fact, I don't feel strong at all. I would even say that I was more confident at the beginning, because I wasn't seeing clearly. The experience has taught me how little I know, and how much more work I need to do."
,KESS-T4,Q3 2018,"Personal, Colleagues",story,,,Moderate,appreciation/affirmation,"In grade 1, we were trying to collect some materials for class, but the principal told us there wasn't any money for it. I was working so hard for the children, and it just left me with a feeling that I was not being supported in that. And I took that very hard. As soon as I became principal I vowed to never be that way to my own teachers, and in fact I've worked to prepare materials for them. But now I've found a new discouragement, because the teachers don't use what I've made for them. So in both cases it's an experience of working hard to do something for the children, and feeling unappreciated."
,KESS-T4,Q3 2018,"Personal, Colleagues",scenario,,,Moderate,"appreciation/affirmation, leadership","I think some of the teachers feel like I micro-manage them, since I like to have everything well-ordered. But a few parents seem to appreciate this quality in me. They tell me that the children seem better disciplined and the classroom is better organized when I'm teaching them, and the children can go through their work step by step."
,KESS-T4,Q3 2018,"Colleagues, Community",story,,,Strong,"appreciation/affirmation, questioning authority, social pressure","One time there was a parent who showed up drunk, and started a fight with a teacher. He was insulting one of the teachers, and even acted like he was going to punch him. When we told the school committee about this incident, they said ""It's ok, it's ok, don't worry about that. Even if he said bad things about the teacher, please just come and apologize to him."" Actually, I wasn't here at the time, I was told about it afterward, but the school committee asked all the teachers to come and apologize to this man, to soothe his anger and make the problem go away. But when I heard about this later I told them, ""This is not good for my teachers, to treat them this way. They did nothing wrong, why should they apologize?"" This man even went to one of the teachers' houses and shouted for them to come out, that he would teach them a lesson. This kind of thing has happened more than once, and I feel it's not good for our teachers. Not safe. And the school committee just wants to avoid a fight. But I don't want to just accept that. And so this is difficult. It's bad enough that a parent would do this, but it makes it worse when the school committee won't support us in these cases.

"
,KESS-T4,Q3 2018,Colleagues,scenario,,,Moderate,"leadership, governance","When it comes to decision-making around the school, I feel like I actually have to make most of the day-to-day school decisions. Like when the children fight, or the teachers argue, I'm the one that needs to deal with it. We also realized that we weren't keeping good records about our children's reports, and so I had to change this situation with better policy and practice. Also starting the library, I'm the one who got that going, and had to get support from the various committees."
,KESS-T4,Q3 2018,Community,scenario,,,Moderate,"shared ownership, blame","It seems like a lot of people in the community blame us. They say things like ""it's your school."" I want to say, ""No, it's not just our school. It's a community school. We all need to work on this together."" But not many people are ready to see it that way."
,KESS-T5,Q3 2018,"Personal, Community",story,,,Moderate,creativity,"When I first heard about this education program I was actually teaching from home, as a private English tutor for a boarding house that my sister runs. I didn't have space for my students, so I went to look for a room I could rent in the evenings for that purpose, and that's what brought me to the school. I saw there what the teachers and students were doing in the classroom, and that made me interested. I suppose it was the work that was posted on the wall that first caught my eye. It was just so obviously different and creative, not just rote work. When I was teaching my own students, I had to follow the government approach just so that they could improve by those standards. And I wasn't happy about that. A lot of times the point of the lesson wasn't clear, so I just had the students memorize it. It made me feel guilty, like I wasn't really helping them as a teacher. That's when I shifted to try to teach my own classes that did a little more with grammar and communication, looking for a better way to teach. And that's what made this style of education appealing to me."
,KESS-T5,Q3 2018,"Personal, family",scenario,,,Moderate,supporting family,"Sometimes I feel I'm letting my family down. They are the ones who are always supporting me, and I haven't been able to do anything to support them. I want to help here in this education project, but it takes up all my time and energy. Sometimes I feel the price is too high. I'd like to develop myself as a teacher, but I don't want to get pulled into all these multi-tasking roles: curriculum development, administration, etc. I want to be able to focus on one thing and do it well."
,KESS-T5,Q3 2018,"Personal, Community",story,,,Moderate,"dialogue, empathy","There was a time when one of the children in grade 6 was a bit naughty: he didn't want to participate or obey the teachers. So his teacher told me about his behavior. My first reaction was to scold him angrily, but somewhere along the way I changed my mind and tried to have a more thoughtful conversation with him. I told him that we knew he was on the verge of becoming a teenager, and this can be a difficult period of life to adjust to. I told him that we understood his situation, and if he needed any help he could come to us. But that he also needed to understand the teacher's situation. At the time there was only one grade 6 teacher, who was a bit overworked. So I talked to him in a humble way. And afterward he started to do better, participate in class more and not cause trouble. I felt like I made a difference."
,KESS-T5,Q3 2018,Personal,scenario,,,Strong,"depression, perseverance","There have been many times that I've felt like I wanted to give up teaching. But then I think about the children. I mean, sometimes the situation with the kids is the very thing that makes us feel depressed and want to give up. But at the same time they are still the reason to keep going.
"
,KESS-T5,Q3 2018,Community,scenario,,,Moderate,"appreciation/affirmation, blaming others, ","I sometimes feel appreciated by the parents, but not that much, I have to say. It's not really part of Kachin culture to express appreciation for someone else's work. In fact it's much easier to blame. I think that's how most of the teachers feel. This reminds me of something my sister was telling me. She has two kids at our school, and so one time when I was talking with her about tensions with parents, she said, ""The teachers think they are doing this for the parents, and the parents think they are doing things for the teachers, when in fact all of us are doing it for the Kachin people."" Many parents in fact feel that their duty is finished once they send their kids to school, that it's out problem and not theirs. But some are very supportive.

"
,KESS-T5,Q3 2018,Personal,story,,,Strong,"intrinsic motivation, self-direction","The main thing that's changed about me since being involved in this program is that it's revived my interest in improving myself, in learning more. I realize I need to learn more in order to help my students and school. You know, in 2010 I attended a prep class in Myitkyina, and I was on track to apply for a scholarship for further study. But I didn't really apply myself, and wasn't very motivated. I didn't see it through. But after starting with SJN I see more clearly that we need to improve ourselves in order to help others. I feel motivated now in a way I haven't been before. I've taken some further study programs, and took leave to study for the IELTs exam, and am now looking to apply for further study programs.

"
,KESS-T5,Q3 2018,Personal,scenario,,,Weak,social skills,"Another big way I've changed is just that … well, I didn't used to speak to strangers. I've never been very strong in communication or social situations, but after working here, between teaching, training, and meeting with parents I've had to really grow in this area. I feel I used to be very self-absorbed, and now I'm spending a lot more time thinking about other people. I think this work has tempered my ego.
"
,KESS-T5,Q3 2018,Family,scenario,,,Weak,supporting family,"If you asked my family how I've changed, I think they would respond with negative things. Mainly because I don't do any housework now, I'm so busy at school. My family doesn't really complain to me about it, and I think they understand I'm busy, but I don't think they are happy about it. I spend most of my time at school, and can't help the family out financially.

"
,KESS-T5,Q3 2018,Community,scenario,,,Weak,"social pressure, drug use","One thing is that I'm proud of about the kids, especially the older ones, is that they seem to stay out of the problems that their peers get into, especially with drugs, but also other ways of getting into trouble. Our kids seem to be happy at school and love each other. They now have an extracurricular karate program at school, for example, and recently they went to a competition in Mandalay and won a prize. I'm proud of them to step up and do something like this. It's not really about the prize. It's that when they were living here they didn't know much about the wider world, they just stayed in their own neighborhoods. But now they have some idea of other places, they can talk about how Yangon is or how Mandalay is. It also gives them something active to engage in and not get drawn into the drugs. My main worry is that their relatives are addicted, and drugs are easily available, but so far they seem to be steering clear.

"
,KESS-T5,Q3 2018,Community,scenario,,,Moderate,"governance, power sharing","The teachers are active in decision-making for the school. At the end of the school year and before classes open we have big meetings to make plans for the school calendar in the coming year. We also decide on school activities for like sports or extra-curricular activities, where it's also worth pointing out that we involve the parents, get their ideas. At the moment we don't have our own school buildings (we are using church buildings), and are making plans for new buildings in a new location. When the school committee is making these plans, they will call teachers to come in and talk with them about this, so I feel we are involved. In general I feel that the committee respects our decisions, and gives us the space to manage ourselves and make our own decisions about the school. They don't micromanage us. The parents committee is also very supportive, helping with the costs for meals and the karate teacher, etc. The only real point of tension is just that finances are really tight, and so any proposal that involves money is hard to agree on.
