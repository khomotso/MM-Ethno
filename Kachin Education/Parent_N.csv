,KESSP1,Q2 2018,KESS,Indirect B,"Personal, Relationships","Youthful maturity, setting an example","Considerate, mature, thoughtfulness but otherwise unclear",Un-specified,"What the parents have learned from him is that they should not be rude to each other. Before, she and her husband used to quarrel a lot, but since their son has been attending the school they don't quarrel anymore. Even their relationship with their neighbors has improved. She credits the example and influence of her son for this. She credits the school's influence for his development into a role model for others. "
,"KESSP7,8",Q2 2018,KESS,Indirect B,"Personal, Relationships","Dealing with hardship, pride, shame? , inclusive problem-solving","Empathy, uninhibited, receptiveness",,"They are a poor family, and the mother struggles to pay the school fees. One day when the girl was in 4th grade, the mother sat her down and tried to explain this issue to her. She told her that she might need to do other work, such as the neighbour’s laundry, in order to scrape enough money together for the school. The daughter sat quietly at first, but then tears started welling up in her eyes, and then she finally begged her mother: ""Please don't do that!""

The shocking thing about that experience was just how much understanding and empathy her daughter showed. When she (the mother) was a child and heard about her parents’ struggles, she couldn't really process it at the time. Instead, she just acknowledged such things as a fact about the world that needed to be dealt with. To have a young child who could see into her, share her humiliation and have such strong feelings about it, it was astonishing.

,"KESSP7,8",Q2 2018,KESS,Indirect B,"Personal, Relationships","Child development & individuality, building of parent-child relationship","Extremely curious, but otherwise unclear",,"They have had to travel in recent months, for church activities or conventions. They've had to go to both Mandalay and Myitkyina in the last year. And whenever they make a trip like this, her daughter is always taking pictures, asking questions, and asking more about their plans in advance. Like that famous long bridge in the Kachin state. They were riding a motorbike, and it was a very hot day. Her daughter said, ""Mom, let's get off and walk from here."" Her Mom said, ""Oh, it's very hot, let's just get across."" But her daughter really wanted to savor the experience of the bridge, and give it close attention.
The lesson her mother took from that is how open and alert to experience her daughter is. Most of us just deal with the surface of life, try to be comfortable, and get from one point to the next without really paying attention. Her daughter wants to really experience life.

,"KESSP7,8",Q2 2018,KESS,Indirect B,"Personal, Relationships",Traditional ways of looking at education and children that discourages personal growth. ,"Curiosity, but otherwise unclear",,"Her son who is entering grade 2 is a very sensitive child, to the point that sometimes tears will roll down his cheeks while he's asking questions. But he's very curious to know what he'll be learning ahead of time. After they learn something, he will ask his mother what they will be learning next. She tells him what he has is enough for now, and he should just leave it there, and she doesn't want to jump ahead of his teacher's plan. But he says he's just curious to know, and he won't disturb the plan. That kind of curiosity about future lessons is very unusual among children in the government school. Their daily lessons are already overloaded; they have no curiosity about what comes next."
,"KESSP7,8",Q2 2018,KESS,Indirect B,Personal,"Learning from and understanding the value of personal qualtiies, not their academic abilities. How change in child doesn't necessarily reflect a change in family.","leadership, social intellect, mostly unclear",,"She (the mother) confesses that she has a short temper. But after seeing the children develop in this way she's learning to be more patient with them, and indeed more patient in general. Her son’s personality is always changing. In grade 1, he was always teasing and annoying the other kids, but as he’s gotten older he doesn't do that so much. He still struggles with his studies, and had to repeat grade 4, following the recommendation of his teacher. Even so, he's very insightful and socially adept. While he was initially ashamed to repeat a grade, he's doing very well now and has learned from his failures. One day at school they took nominations from the children about who should serve in a leadership role, and he got a lot of votes from everyone. He was surprised about this, because he didn't think of himself in this way. But it’s clear that others recognise his leadership abilities."
,"KESSP7,8",Q2 2018,KESS,Indirect B,"Personal, Relationships","Exposure to individuality, freedom of expression ","Uninhibited, creative thinking",,"Her neighbours often come to her house to visit, and bring their kids. Her grade 3 daughter once started to draw a picture in front of the other kids, and as she was drawing the picture she started to tell a story about what was going on in it. Then she ran out of space to draw, but continued to tell her story just from the thoughts in her head, and the other children just sat watching her, rapt. The other parents were also amazed, that someone could do something like this, just follow her imagination on the spot. The things that other children know come from memorizing and repeating, not inventing like that."
,KESSP9,Q2 2018,KESS/NS,Direct ,"Personal, Relationships","Personal growth, youthful maturity, family connection, taking initiative","Maybe thoughtfulness, enthusiasm for learning, but unclear",,"My niece, my sister's daughter, moved to town from China a few years ago. She was quite rude at first. Sometimes she would run away from home, and go to sleep in the forest. But after going to the community school her behavior has much improved. She started to behave well. She seems to love attending the school. She never wants to miss a day. She's able to express love to family members now, like she made a gift for her grandmother and said she loved her, which is something she never did before."
,KESSP10/11*,Q2 2018,KESS/NS,Indirect,Community,"Inclusive problem-solving in family, thinking for yourself ","Mature, considered thinking",,"The differences between children from government school and community school are visible only within the family. He sees children from government schools just do what they are told. But his child in the community school, always ask ""Why?"" They want to understand, not just follow orders. One specific example is that his daughter got involved with their discussion when they were trying to build out the sewer drains that run out from their house to the street. The daughter piped up to point out that this sort of construction really needed to involve an expert who knows the city system, and it's not just something for people to try and do for themselves in a haphazard way. "
,KESSP12,Q2 2018,KESS/NS,Indirect,"Personal, Community","Leadership, taking initiative ",Uninhibited,,"In the music camp, there were many participants from government schools, and even university students older than my son who is grade 5 community student including his older sister. Nobody dare to speak up, or lead a group prayer, or lead as a chairperson to lead a worship session. But my son dared to do that, and he spoke out very clearly in front of the others."
,KESSP12,Q2 2018,KESS/NS,Indirect,"Personal, Relationships","Self-reflection, awareness, self-improvement",Mindfullness,,"One time my son caused a problem with some of his friends, and when I heard about it, it made me very angry. And I grabbed up a stick and ran out to beat him. But he cried out, ""Wait! Wait! Tell me what I did wrong first, at least! If you're going to beat me, beat me, but give me a reason!"" It made her stop and think, and she realized he was right. If the punishment wasn't linked to an instructive purpose, it was just empty violence. I also learned to know one’s limit and to appreciate it, from my son’s self-awareness. Like he says that he's good at languages, but not good at maths. "
,KESSP12,Q2 2018,KESS/NS,Indirect,"Personal, Relationships",Intrinsic motivation to want to change,,,"I used to beat the older ones a lot, when they were younger. I would even take out my frustrations on them, and beat them not because of something they did but because of something I was upset about in my own life. Later I realized I needed to change my parenting. It is not because of the school or the program, but I read some parenting books, books on child psychology, and talked with other educated parents about how they raise their children. Finally my eyes were opened, and I decided not to beat my youngest two children in the same way. I can see now that my oldest child and youngest child are very different as a result. The oldest one doesn't have any ambition, but the youngest one seems very self-driven. My youngest daughter once overheard the piano teacher praised her brother, and so then she started to wake up very early and practiced piano harder, until she could earn the teacher's praise. I never saw that kind of drivenness in my oldest daughter. I think this is because of the excessive punishment, and I feel guilty about that. I told my oldest daughter that when she was young she got very sick, and that's why she's a slow learner. But secretly I am afraid it's my own fault."
,KESSP13/14,Q2 2018,KESS/NS,Indirect,"Personal, Community","Individuality, thinking for oneself","Uninhibited, thinking independently",,"My youngest daughter who attends the community school is more self-directed, and doesn't need extra coaching from her mother while the two older ones need more pushing to do their studies. Her two oldest daughters don't dare to give their opinions or suggestions. But the youngest one speaks very openly about her own ideas. Her older sisters tell her this is rude. My youngest daughter can pray with her own words, but her brother who attends government school can't, and just copies what his sister says. Or when it comes to writing essays. She had to write an essay about a cat one time. So she sat and looked at the cat, and tried to write how she saw it behave, not just the book explanation on cats."
,KESSP15,Q2 2018,KESS/NS,Indirect,Personal/family,"Selflessness, family devotion","Considerateness, maturity",,"This past year the mother has had health problems that keep her from working as much as she wants to support the children. The youngest daughter actually volunteered to leave the community school and go to government school in order to reduce the financial burden. But the mother insisted that she continue. Some weeks ago the mother's health problems worsened, and she had very sharp pains in her legs, like something was chewing on her bones, and that left her bedridden. The children were all crying to see her in that state. The youngest daughter was also crying at first, but then roused herself and said that instead of crying she should go pray and the mother saw that as a strong sign both of her maturity and faith in God. The daughter also said she wished she could give her legs to her mother, to take away the pain. "
,KEKS-P1,Q2 2018,KEKS,Indirect,"Personal, family ","Youthful maturity, setting an example in the family",,,"My sister-in-law is an ECCD head teacher. She has always known a lot, but it didn't change her. Now she finds that she is being changed by her child. For example, one day I brought some clothes for the poor in the hills. My niece had already chosen an item she liked. But because the clothes were very nice, her mother wanted more. The mother wanted to exchange some of her old clothes for the newer ones that were meant for the poor. My niece told her mother not to do that. Finally, the mother listened. The mother said, “I’ve learned from my daughter.” So, if you want change, the change has to start with you. I told my sister-in-law this. Her way of talking has changed. She would stare at people even though she didn't want people staring at her. Her child pointed this out to her, and she took it to heart."
,KEKS-P1,Q2 2018,KEKS,Indirect B,"Personal, family ",Setting an example in the family ,"Responsible, considered",,"I’m often out of the house the whole day. So the children ask me, “Where have you been? Why have you been away all day?” Such questions show that they have learned how to think critically. Sometimes, I would give pocket money to my nieces, each one receiving 5000 kyats. My youngest niece would learn from her."
,KEKS-P5,Q2 2018,KEKS,Indirect B,"Personal, family ",,,,"A lot. Although not very important, e.g. When I say strongly to do something, the child would say, “Mum, do you need to be so angry? You can say that in a soft voice also”. When I heard that, it made me think.
When there is some favor to ask, my daughter won’t do that directly. E.g. “Mum, let us go this way. It is much better.” Then she would take me to a store. “Mum, I want to have something. Please don’t get angry.” Then she would say, “Mum, I’d like something to eat.” Step by step, she would lead me where she wanted.
The time to say night prayers is 8:30 p.m. Five minutes before that, she goes upstairs, and prepares herself. There is no need to tell her what to do. She does it by herself. She has become a responsible child. I’m happy to see that she has learned so much.
"
,KEKS-P5,Q2 2018,KEKS,Indirect B,"Personal, family ",,,,"In the beginning, we parents learned more than the children. In the past when we had to go somewhere, we had to push the children to get ready quickly. We could get frustrated and angry with them. Now she says, “I know when we need to go. I'll be ready in time, no need to get angry.”
That’s what we could not teach before. We can count on them now. They have become responsible. We need not push them.
In the past we felt that to get good result we need to do it by ourselves. Now we let the children do what they can do. Not sharing responsibilities is spoiling children.
When we forbid a child from going to a certain place, we have to explain why. Before, it was an order. No question. That’s how we were brought up.
Her elder sister is a difficult person. We could do nothing about that. There would be fights and yelling.
Now it is different. Because the younger sister has changed, the elder sister has too. Before, she would not
get up early. Now, she gets up early and washes her own clothes. 
Angry words were not acceptable to the girls. Now we discuss things openly, and I ask their opinions. To be this way was difficult in the beginning. I could become angry. I had to control my temper. Now it is more smooth. There is balance now.
The transformation in children and in us parents is quite evident compared to the beginning.
In the past the time for going to school was hectic. “This past year we haven't heard any more yelling and shouting,” commented a neighbor to me recently. I hadn't realized it was that bad before, that even the neighbors have noticed the change.
"
,KEKS-P2,Q2 2018,KEKS,Indirect B,"Personal, family ",,,,"Sometimes I wonder about how to treat my children. For example, when the children were playing I once said, “You’re being ridiculous.” I said it without thinking. Then the child said, “Mum, you’re looking down on me.” When the child said that, I felt very sorry. I realized what I had said had hurt her. What I learned is that when I say things the child feels it deeply.
My social dealings with others have changed a lot. Now, I can deal with anybody. In the church, when people discuss things concerning education, I have a lot of ideas to share. Not only with education, but also with consideration for others, I have learned a lot.
