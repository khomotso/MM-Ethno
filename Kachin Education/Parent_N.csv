,KESSP1,Q2 2018,"Personal, family, community",,,,,"learning from children, rudeness, gentleness","What we the parents have learned from our son is that we should not be rude to each other. Before, I and my husband used to quarrel a lot, but since our son has been attending the school we don't quarrel so much anymore. Even our relationship with our neighbors has improved. I credit the example and influence of my son for this. His good nature has made him a role model for us."
,"KESSP7,8",Q2 2018,"Personal, family",,,,,"different children, empathy","We are a poor family, and struggle to pay the school fees. One day when our daughter was in 4th grade, I sat her down and tried to explain this issue to her. I told her that I might need to go around and offer to do the neighbor's laundry, in order to pay the school fees. The daughter sat quietly at first, but then tears started welling up in her eyes, and then she finally begged me: ""Please don't do that!"" The shocking thing about that experience was just how much understanding and empathy my daughter showed. When I was a child and heard about my parents’ struggles, I couldn't really process it at the time. Instead, I just took such things as a simple fact about the world. To have a young child who could see my struggles, share in my embarrassment and have such strong feelings about it, it was astonishing to me.

,"KESSP7,8",Q2 2018,"Personal, family",,,,,"different children, curiosity, learning from children","We have had to travel in recent months, for church activities or conventions. We've had to go to both Mandalay and Myitkyina in the last year. And whenever twe make a trip like this, my daughter is always taking pictures, asking questions, and asking more about our plans in advance. Like that famous long bridge in the Kachin state. We were riding a motorbike, and it was a very hot day. My daughter said, ""Mom, let's get off and walk from here."" I resisted at first, ""Oh, it's very hot, let's just get across."" But my daughter really wanted to savor the experience of the bridge, and give it close attention. So we got down and we walked, and I tried to be patient with her questions. The lesson I took from that is how open and alert to experience my daughter is. Most of us just deal with the surface of life, try to be comfortable, and get from one point to the next without really paying attention. My daughter wants to really experience life.
"
,"KESSP7,8",Q2 2018,"Personal, family",,,,,"different children, curiosity","My son who is entering grade 2 is a very sensitive child, to the point that sometimes tears will roll down his cheeks while he's asking questions. But he's very curious to know what he'll be learning ahead of time. After they learn something, he will ask me what they will be learning next. I tell him what he has is enough for now, and he should just leave it there, and I don't want to jump ahead of his teacher's plan. But he says he's just curious to know, and he won't disturb the plan. That kind of curiosity about future lessons is very unusual among children in the government school. Their daily lessons are already overloaded; they have no curiosity about what comes next."
,"KESSP7,8",Q2 2018,"Personal, community",,,,,"different children, social skills","My son used to tease and annoy the other kids when he was young, but as he’s gotten older he doesn't do that so much. He still struggles with his studies, and had to repeat grade 4, following the recommendation of his teacher. Even so, he's very insightful and socially adept. While he was initially ashamed to repeat a grade, he's doing very well now and has learned from his failures. One day at school they took nominations from the children about who should serve in a leadership role, and he got a lot of votes from everyone. He was surprised about this, because he didn't think of himself as a leader. But it’s clear that others recognise this in him.
"
,"KESSP7,8",Q2 2018,"family, community",,,,,"different children, creativity, self-expression","My Ta'ang neighbours often come to my house to visit, and bring their kids. My grade 3 daughter once started to draw a picture in front of the other kids, and as she was drawing the picture she started to tell a story about what was going on in it. Then she ran out of space to draw, but continued to tell her story just from the thoughts in her head, and the other children just sat watching her, rapt. The other parents were also amazed, that someone could do something like this, just follow her imagination spontaneously. The things that other children know come from memorizing and repeating, not inventing like that. Those same parents started asking me about the school then, they were so impressed."
,KESSP9,Q2 2018,"Personal, family",,,,,"different children, rudeness, self-expression","My niece, my sister's daughter, moved to town from China a few years ago. She was quite rude at first. Sometimes she would run away from home, and go to sleep in the forest. But after going to the community school her behavior has much improved. She started to behave well. She seems to love attending the school. She never wants to miss a day. She's able to express love to family members now, like she made a gift for her grandmother and said she loved her, which is something she never did before."
,KESSP10/11*,Q2 2018,"Personal, family, community",,,,,"different children, questioning authority, confidence to speak, maturity","The differences between children from government school and community school are visible mainly within the family. I see the children from government schools just do what they are told. But my daughter in the community school always asks ""Why?"" They want to understand, not just follow orders. One specific example is that my daughter got involved with our discussion when we were trying to build out the sewer drains that run out from our house to the street. The daughter spoke up to point out that this sort of construction really needed to involve an expert who knows the city system, and it's not just something for people to try and do for themselves in a haphazard way. "
,KESSP10/11*,Q2 2018,"Personal, family",,,,,"different children, maturity, self-direction","I sent my oldest (daughter) to the community school at first, but then my confidence in the school wavered, and I sent my second child (son) to the government school. I reasoned that the government curriculum is already completed, the school system is a known quantity, stable, has resources, while in contrast the community school teachers are new and relatively unskilled, and beyond all that the government school is free. But then after another year or two I started to see the differences in my daughter, differences of character and being able to think for herself, and why the community school is valuable beyond reading and writing. So I changed my mind yet again and sent my youngest back to the community school."
,KESSP12,Q2 2018,"Personal, Community",,,,,"different children, confidence to speak","My son attended a music camp in the summer, where there were many participants from government schools, and even university students older than my son who is in grade 5. All those other children were shy, too shy to volunteer to lead a group prayer, or lead as a chairperson to lead a worship session. But my son was always ready to do so, and he spoke out very clearly in front of the others."
,KESSP12,Q2 2018,"Personal, family",,,,,"learning from children, violence","One time my son caused a problem with some of his friends, and when I heard about it, it made me very angry. I grabbed up a stick and ran out to beat him. But he cried out, ""Wait! Wait! Tell me what I did wrong first, at least! If you're going to beat me, beat me, but give me a reason!"" It made me stop and think, and I realized he was right. If the punishment wasn't linked to an instructive purpose, it was just empty violence. I've changed the way I think about punishing my children from that."
,KESSP12,Q2 2018,"Personal, family",,,,,"learning from children, self-awareness","My son has been a good example to me about knowing one’s limits and to accept them, from my son’s self-awareness. Like he says that he's good at languages, but not good at maths. He accepts this, and doesn't just try to be boastful about everything."
,KESSP12,Q2 2018,"Personal, family",,,,,"violence, self-awareness, learning from children, parenting","I used to beat the older children a lot, when they were younger. I would even take out my frustrations on them, and beat them not because of something they did but because of something I was upset about in my own life. Later I realized I needed to change my parenting. It is not because of the school or the program, but I read some parenting books, books on child psychology, and talked with other educated parents about how they raise their children. Finally my eyes were opened, and I decided not to beat my youngest two children in the same way. I can see now that my oldest child and youngest child are very different as a result. The oldest one doesn't have any ambition, but the youngest one seems very self-driven. My youngest daughter once overheard the piano teacher praised her brother, and so then she started to wake up very early and practiced piano harder, until she could earn the teacher's praise. I never saw that kind of drivenness in my oldest daughter. I think this is because of the excessive punishment, and I feel guilty about that. I told my oldest daughter that when she was young she got very sick, and that's why she's a slow learner. But secretly I am afraid it's my own fault."
,KESSP13/14,Q2 2018,"Personal, family",,,,,"different children, self-expression, self-direction, confidence to speak","My youngest daughter who attends the community school is more self-directed, and doesn't need extra coaching from her mother while the two older ones need more pushing to do their studies. Her two oldest daughters don't dare to give their opinions or suggestions. But the youngest one speaks very openly about her own ideas. Her older sisters tell her this is rude. My youngest daughter can pray with her own words, but her brother who attends government school can't, and just copies what his sister says. Or when it comes to writing essays. She had to write an essay about a cat one time. So she sat and looked at the cat, and tried to write how she saw it behave, not just the book explanation on cats."
,KESSP13/14,Q2 2018,"Personal, family, Community",,,,,"social pressure, confidence to speak, learning from children","In the community school, they have a news sharing time that's a standard part of their morning routine for all the children. The children are basically invited to speak up about things that are happening to them. I've learned the hard way [laughs] that if the parents do not behave well at home, their children will talk about them during the morning routine (e.g. my parents were shouting at each other last night). Therefore I have to be careful at home, or the school will gossip about me [laughs again]."
,KESSP13/14,Q2 2018,"Personal, family, community",,,,,"retaining culture, learning from children","My daughter sometimes has questions about the Jinghpaw language that we don't know the answers to. So we have to sometimes ask around to get these answers, and so I end up learning these things from my own children about our culture."
,KESSP15,Q2 2018,"Personal, family",,,,,"Selflessness, family devotion","This past year I have had health problems that keep me from working as much as I want to support the children. The youngest daughter actually volunteered to leave the community school and go to government school in order to reduce the financial burden. But I insisted that she continue. Some weeks ago my health problems worsened, and I had very sharp pains in my legs, like something was chewing on my bones, and that left me bedridden. The children were all crying to see me in that state. The youngest daughter was also crying at first, but then roused herself and said that instead of crying she should go pray and I saw that as a strong sign both of her maturity and faith in God. The daughter also said she wished she could give her legs to her mother, to take away the pain. "
,KESSP15,Q2 2018,"Personal, family",,,,,"different children, conscientious, self-direction, organized, learning from children","All my kids are fairly smart, so the youngest daughter that goes to community school doesn't stand out strongly in that way. But one thing I will say is that she gives more attention to what she wears, and even prepares in advance what she is going to wear the next day. She is also more organized in general, and conscientious about doing her work before she plays. Normally, for example, children don't put away their things or take back their dishes when they are done with them, but my daughter does, and I think this is the school's influence. In fact, it was my daughter who taught me how to make a bed properly, and to be more tidy about those things in general. I'm not sure if this comes from something the school teaches, but it's definitely a place where she's influenced me, her parent."
,KESSP15,Q2 2018,"Personal, family, community",,,,,"children's questions, loss of culture","There are questions my daughter asks me that I don't know the answers to, including questions about Jinghpaw words or Kachin and family history. My generation have lost touch with many of these cultural things, even though it's my culture."
,KESSP15,Q2 2018,"Personal, family, community",,,,,"leadership, hope for education, substance abuse, moral character","Our family is from a very rural area, where the village leader there was very corrupt. In fact we moved to Lashio a few years ago in part to escape all that. So we've had a very bad experience with community leaders over the years. Part of the hope for me for this new style of education is a different quality of leadership for our people. Also, the government school isn't based on any faith, while the community school is. Another important difference is that it uses the child's mother tongue, respects her culture, and also does more with international languages, which should bring more improvement. I see so many youth corrupted with drugs. My hope is that a faith-based education can help pull society out of that.
"
,KESSP16,Q2 2018,"Personal, family",,,,,"different children, confidence to speak, self-direction","My eldest (a daughter) is in grade 9 at the government school, and her younger brother is in grade 6 at the community school. The older one constantly needs to be pushed to keep at her school work, since it's just a lot of memorization, while the younger one is happy, active, and eager to learn. I also find that he is much bolder to speak, and he learns things on his own without being pushed.
"
,KESSP16,Q2 2018,"Personal, community",,,,,"different children, creativity, asking questions","I am a teacher at a local ECCD school, and we prepare young preschoolers who are headed to both government school and the community school. We learned early on that we needed to separate these two groups of children, because they need to be prepared in such different ways. For example, the govt school children have to memorize all the letters, and they get tired of it very quickly, and the teachers have to keep pestering them to keep at it. I feel pity for these children, even though I know they have to do it. This is govt education in a nutshell: memorizing old things, and creating nothing new. In the community school they research things for themselves, ask their own questions, make observations and take notes.
"
,KESSP16,Q2 2018,"Personal, family, community",,,,,"learning from children, collaboration, loss of culture","There are 2 things I've learned from my son in the community school. He is very socially adept, good at working in groups and collaborating with others. I have also learned Kachin history from him, because these are things that many older people have forgotten or never really learned."
,KESSP16,Q2 2018,"personal, family",,,,,"different children, confidence to speak, breaking convention","I am naturally supportive and encouraging to my children, but because the school teaches the children to speak their own opinions freely, my son sometimes says shocking things. Like one time he got the idea that it was healthier to sleep naked, and when he announced this plan to me I was a bit taken aback, and didn't know how to respond."
,KESSP17,Q2 2018,"personal, community",,,,,"motivation, hope for education, leadership","I feel like my generation missed out on the old missionary schools. The generation before me went to such schools, and I have always admired their education and leadership. I regret that I didn't have the same opportunity, and that my generation has been robbed of this experience. So I suppose the way I think of these community schools is that the missionary schools are coming back, and that my children can have a better opportunity.
"
,KESSP17,Q2 2018,"personal, community",,,,,"different children, self-expression, confidence to speak","The main difference I see in my son who goes to the community school is how bold he is in expressing his own ideas. The way I learned in the government school was just to follow what the book says, and I can see this is quite different. When I was a boy I never even really had the chance to talk with and learn from my elders, we were kept separate and supposed to just stay silent, and I think that held us back from really learning. When now I see my sons able to speak and discuss everywhere and with everyone, I feel it's better for all concerned."
,KESSP18,Q2 2018,"personal, family",,,,,"different children, learning disability, behavior problems","When my youngest son was a baby he got seriously ill, and didn't get enough food, and I fear now his brain was damaged by that. I first sent him to government school, but he would just leave the school and wander around town by himself, and so I felt I had to try something else. I heard about this community school, and so thought I would try that. He at least seems to want to go to the community school, and doesn't run away, so that's an improvement. But he doesn't mature like the other children, even after five years he's still in grade 1, and doesn't seem to be able to learn much. In fact, as he's grown older I've started to have trouble with him stealing money and being disobedient. I'm not really sure what to do with him, I think I'm just waiting until he's old enough that he can start to work. For now the school is at least the only place that I don't have to force him to go to, and that's something. If he's happy there, that at least seems like the best I can hope for for now.


"
,KESSP19,Q2 2018,"personal, family",,,,,"different children, self-direction, curiosity, seeing consequences, learning from children","I see so many little differences between my son in the community school and his older brothers. The closest one to him in age is my grade 4 son who goes to private school, and I always have to push him to do his work, or nothing gets done. But my grade 2 son is always getting things done for himself, without any pushing. Whenever I ask him to do something he always gets it done very quickly and effectively. He even wakes up early, like an hour earlier than his brothers. He's motivated by his own curiosity. Even when he's playing, he's always asking questions about his toys, like 'what is it made of'? Or if he has a toy gun, 'How far can it shoot? Will it hurt?' He asks so many questions. He just has this insatiable curiosity that her other sons don't have. And he has his own interests, his own ideas that he wants to pursue. He also seems to be able to think through consequences in a way that his older brothers don't, saying things like, 'If you do this, then something else will happen, etc.' He makes me think about things in new ways, too. Like he's been saying recently that there aren't mistakes, just things that are not yet right. I doesn't know where he got this idea, but it's interesting to me."
,KESSP19,Q2 2018,"personal, family",,,,,"different children, curiosity, learning from children, questions, patience","It's often hard to answer everything my son asks, but I've learned that it's important to just be patient with those questions, and so I try to just answer what I can, and try to learn the things I don't know the answer to so that I can answer his questions. I sometimes read stories to my sons, for example, but I've learned that for my son in the community school it's not enough to just read the story, I also need to prepare answers ahead of time to the questions I know he's going to ask. He's basically forced me to study more things, too."
,KESSP19,Q2 2018,"personal, family, community",,,,,parenting,"I feel this experience has changed me as a parent. Parents who send their children to government school just kind of push them out the door and don't give it a second thought, but now I'm really trying to have discussions with my son's teachers and even other parents about what's going on, and trying to find more ways to support the process. I'm much more involved. Sometimes I won't understand the homework my son is doing, so going into the classroom and seeing the posters on the walls or asking the teacher about it will help me understand what's going on."
,KESSP19,Q2 2018,community,,,,,"community support, inclusion","I think the biggest community change is that in the beginning the church wasn't a strong supporter of the school, even though it's supposed to be church-based. In the past I would say about 75% of the parents in the church didn't care much about it. Now I would say that about 75% of the parents understand the school and support it. In fact we now have to set a limit on the number of new students we can accept, because more want to join than they can accept. And now half of the weekly tithe from the church will go toward the school. They just started doing this last year. I've also been hearing more interest from other ethnic groups about this school - parents asking about how they teach, what curriculum they use, etc. I even hear regret from some parents whose children are now too old that they didn't have this opportunity - they wish the school had started earlier. So it seems interest is growing."
,KESSP20,Q2 2018,"personal, family",,,,,"shy, openness","At first I tried to start my daughter in the government school kindergarten, but she would just cry the whole time, even to the point where I couldn't leave her, and had to stay there with her. So I finally took her out of the government school and to the community school kindergarten instead, and my daughter did much better right away. She remains shy and quiet, but she at least can stay at school on her own, and is happy with her teachers and the other children. She has opened up a bit, and has a real curiosity to her."
,KESSP20,Q2 2018,"personal, family",,,,,"different children, curiosity, maturity, confidence to speak, social skills","One surprising difference is that my daughter doesn't just talk to me about childish things, she also asks mature questions that are sometimes surprisingly insightful. It's hard to recall a specific example, as they're usually about so many detailed things, but ... like when I'm cooking she'll ask about everything I'm using, or why men and women have different titles. I also see her able to find compromises among her circle of friends, and she seems to know how to get along with people well, not just either go along or get into fights. Self-confidence is another obvious difference. You can see this in the way she relates to her older siblings, like showing her how to do something when she has an idea. Or sometimes when the older children talk back to their parents, the younger ones will take the parents side in the argument.

"
,KESSP21,Q2 2018,"personal, family",,,,,"different children, learning from children, curiosity, controlling others, challenging authority","One thing I learned from my son is that I shouldn't try to influence my son's interests, but should give him space to follow his curiosity and do what he wants to do in life. For example, he likes to play with electronic devices. In the beginning I didn't want to let him touch those things, or if it was broken I would tell him we should send it out for repairs and not risk further damage. But he kept pushing me, insisting that he could work on it, and now I let him take things apart as he likes, as he's becoming good at fixing such things.
"
,KESSP22,Q2 2018,"personal, family",,,,,"different children, empathy","One evening it was raining cats and dogs, with lightning and thunder. All the family was in the house, but I (the mother) was out working in the kitchen. My daughter came rushing into the kitchen, crying, and threw her arms around me. ""What's wrong?"" I asked. ""I just feel sorry for you, having to work out here in the kitchen all alone when everyone else is in the house."" This kind of sensitivity is very unusual in a child. I think it's because teachers and students in the school have very loving relationships."
,KESSP22,Q2 2018,community,,,,,"governance, role of parents","Parents get called to school a lot, for various meetings. But mostly I'm too busy and can't go. They had a meeting just this last Saturday, for example, but I couldn't go. I just know all the parents were invited. One earlier meeting I went to they talked about facilities for handling trash. So a lot of it is discussing resource needs, and to get resources from parents for some school need. 
"
,KESSP23,Q2 2018,"personal, family",,,,,"different children, confidence to speak, maturity, asking questions","I used to live in the village, and sent my children to a boarding house for students in Kutkai. It was the headmistress of the boarding house that first told me about this new SJN school. It sounded like it was a school with foreigners teaching English well, which I thought would be a good thing. When I learned that wasn't the case, I sent my children anyway, and thought it was just an OK school. But after the first year or two I started to see in my (grade 6) daughter not just education, but a kind of maturity, even wisdom. Whenever she's given responsibility she does well; she knows what to do and how to speak. Along with that a surprising degree of self-confidence. For example, her older brother (grade 7) is quite good in school, and even won a prize in mathematics one year, but he is so shy he didn't even want to go and accept his prize. He likes doing his work well, but for him it's only about absorbing what the teachers tell him, and can't question things. He never asks me questions I can't answer like my daughters do. But my daughter in the community school always seems ready to stand up and take charge, like in church when they ask for volunteers to read from the Bible or lead a prayer."
,KESSP23,Q2 2018,"personal, family",,,,,"different children, challenging authority, learning from children","I learned from my daughters not to force them to do just the things she wants them to do, but to let them follow their own curiosity and make their own choices. Most people here are used to sending their children around to all kinds of tuition programs after school, and fill up all their time with things like that. I do that with my son, the eldest, and so started to push my daughters into these programs as well. But they objected, quite strongly in fact, insisting it wasn't fair. At first I just told them to do as they were told and not talk back, but they continued to insist. They said it's not right to just give them orders all the time, and leave them with no free time during the day. Eventually I started to feel that they were right, and I don't send them to tuition like I do my son. 
"
,KESSP23,Q2 2018,"personal, family, community",,,,,teacher-parent relationship,"One of the big differences with this community school is that I actually know the teacher of my children. I talk to my daughter's teachers half a dozen times a year. I have no idea who my son's teachers are. In fact, if I went to the government school to talk to the teachers, it would be to a group of them, because of something bad my son had done. Some serious disciplinary issue for the school. It would never even come up to talk about how he's doing in class."
,KESSP23,Q2 2018,community,,,,,"governance, role of parents","It's good that the parents come together to discuss school issues. This kind of thing never happens with the government schools. In the government school the parents don't even know each other. Just last Saturday we had a meeting of parents where we talked about how the students need to arrive at school on time, and what the starting time should be. We also discussed about whether to create an extracurricular music class. There are meetings like this about 4 times a year. It's good that we have this, but I think overall the parents aren't as involved as they could be, and I would like to see more participation from them, and have them more involved in making decisions. In fact, I'm not really sure how the school makes its important decisions now. I guess the church decides? 
"
,KESSP24,Q2 2018,community,,,,,"different children, questioning authority, rudeness","The government school children don't seem gentle, they seem rude. The community school children seem more gentle. Another thing is that the children have lots of questions, and can question their elders boldly (e.g. sometimes they point out contradictions in what their elders say), while the government school children don't do that."
,KESSP24,Q2 2018,community,,,,,"governance, leadership, organizational behavior","I feel the way the school is managed could be improved. I feels that each teacher should have full authority about their own class; it's not a good dynamic if the principal tries to interfere. If the teachers could work together as a kind of family, it would be better than just the principal giving orders, and it happens too much like that now."
,KESSP24,Q2 2018,community,,,,,"social pressure, community tension","There's a bit of tension in the community around this school, because there is one group of parents which cares about it, and one which doesn't. The church has begun to contribute strongly to the school, and not everyone is supportive of that. What heightens this tension is that much of the school activities depends on the contributions of the parents, and most of them are quite poor."
,KEKS-P1,Q2 2018,"Personal, family ",,,,,"learning from children, maturity, empathy","My sister-in-law is an ECCD head teacher. She has always known a lot of things, but that knowledge didn't change her as a person. Now she finds that she is being changed by her child. For example, one day I brought some clothes for the poor in the hills, and told my sister and niece they could take one if they found something they needed. My niece had already chosen an item she liked. But because the clothes were very nice, her mother wanted to take more than one. She wanted to exchange some of her old clothes for the newer ones that were meant for the poor. My niece objected, and told her mother she shouldn't do that. In the end the mother relented, and said, “I’ve learned from my daughter.”"
,KEKS-P1,Q2 2018,"Personal, family ",,,,,"different children, questioning authority","I’m often out of the house the whole day, and when I do that and come back the children will challenge me, “Where have you been? Why have you been away all day?” This sort of questioning is unusual, and I think it shows that they have learned how to think for themselves."
,KEKS-P5,Q2 2018,"Personal, family ",,,,,"different children, gentleness, self-control","There are times when I raise my voice, and my child responds, “Do you need to be so angry? You can say that in a soft voice also”. When I heard that, it made me stop and think. 
"
,KEKS-P5,Q2 2018,"Personal, family ",,,,,different children,"When my daughter wants to ask for some favor, she won’t go at it directly. Like when we're out walking she'll steer us down a road that goes past a store where she wants to buy something. Then as we pass the store she'll mention that there's something she wants to get. Step by step, she leads me where she wants to go.
"
,KEKS-P5,Q2 2018,"Personal, family ",,,,,"different children, maturity",The time to say night prayers is 8:30 p.m. Five minutes before that my daughter will go upstairs and prepare herself. There is no need to remind her what to do. She does it by herself. She has become a responsible child. I’m happy to see that she has learned so much.
,KEKS-P5,Q2 2018,"Personal, family, community",,,,,"different children, maturity, self-direction, learning from children","In the past when we had to go somewhere, we had to push the children to get ready quickly. We could get frustrated and angry with them. Now my daughter says, “I know when we need to go. I'll be ready in time, no need to get angry.” Even her elder sister, who was always especially difficult in this way, has come around. We used to have such fights and yelling with her about these things. Now it is different. Because the younger sister has changed, the elder sister has, too. Before, she would not get up early. Now, she gets up early and washes her own clothes. That’s what we could not teach before, but we can count on them now. They have become responsible. We need not push them. In the past we felt that to get a good result we needed to push them at every step. Now we let the children handle themselves, and the house is more peaceful as a result. Even the neighbors have noticed this, I was shocked to find out. “This past year we haven't heard any more yelling and shouting,” commented a neighbor to me recently. I hadn't realized it was that bad before."
,KEKS-P5,Q2 2018,"Personal, family ",,,,,"different children, questioning authority","When we forbid a child from going to a certain place, we have to explain why now. Before, it was an order. No questions asked. That’s how we were brought up. But now we need to explain things to our children."
,KEKS-P5,Q2 2018,"Personal, family ",,,,,"different children, gentleness, dialogue, self-control","Angry words are not acceptable to the girls. Now we discuss things openly, and I ask their opinions. To be this way was difficult in the beginning. I could become angry. I had to control my temper. Now it is more smooth. There is balance now."
,KEKS-P2,Q2 2018,"Personal, family ",,,,,"different children, sensitivity, learning from children, parenting","Sometimes I worry about my parenting. For example, when the children were playing in a silly way I once said, “You’re being ridiculous.” I said it without thinking. My child seemed insulted and said, “Mom, you’re looking down on me.” When I heard that, I regretted my remark. I realized what I had said hurt her. What I learned is that when I say things the child feels it deeply. Watching my daughter and thinking about how she is growing has affected my own social dealings with others. Now I feel I can speak with anybody. In the church, when people discuss things concerning education, I have a lot of ideas to share. Not only with education, but also with consideration for others. I have learned a lot.
