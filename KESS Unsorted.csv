,KESSP1,Q2 2018,KESS,Indirect B,"Personal, Relationships",Unclear,Story but unsubstantiated,"What the parents have learned from him is that they should not be rude to each other. Before, she and her husband used to quarrel a lot, but since their son has been attending the school they don't quarrel anymore. Even their relationship with their neighbors has improved. She credits the example and influence of her son for this. She credits the school's influence for his development into a role model for others."
,"KESSP7,8",Q2 2018,KESS,Indirect B,"Personal, Relationships","Empathy, compassion",Story,"They are a poor family, and the mother struggles to pay the school fees. One day when the girl was in 4th grade, the mother sat her down and tried to explain this issue to her. She told her that she might need to do other work, such as the neighbour’s laundry, in order to scrape enough money together for the school. The daughter sat quietly at first, but then tears started welling up in her eyes, and then she finally begged her mother: ""Please don't do that!""The shocking thing about that experience was just how much understanding and empathy her daughter showed. When she (the mother) was a child and heard about her parents’ struggles, she couldn't really process it at the time. Instead, she just acknowledged such things as a fact about the world that needed to be dealt with. To have a young child who could see into her, share her humiliation and have such strong feelings about it, it was astonishing."
,"KESSP7,8",Q2 2018,KESS,Indirect B,Personal,"Inquisitive, curious, but otherwise unclear",Story,"They have had to travel in recent months, for church activities or conventions. They've had to go to both Mandalay and Myitkyina in the last year. And whenever they make a trip like this, her daughter is always taking pictures, asking questions, and asking more about their plans in advance. Like that famous long bridge in the Kachin state. They were riding a motorbike, and it was a very hot day. Her daughter said, ""Mom, let's get off and walk from here."" Her Mom said, ""Oh, it's very hot, let's just get across."" But her daughter really wanted to savor the experience of the bridge, and give it close attention.
The lesson her mother took from that is how open and alert to experience her daughter is. Most of us just deal with the surface of life, try to be comfortable, and get from one point to the next without really paying attention. Her daughter wants to really experience life.

,"KESSP7,8",Q2 2018,KESS,Indirect B,Personal,"Intellectual curiosity, but otherwise unclear","Story, but unsubstantiated","Her son who is entering grade 2 is a very sensitive child, to the point that sometimes tears will roll down his cheeks while he's asking questions. But he's very curious to know what he'll be learning ahead of time. After they learn something, he will ask his mother what they will be learning next. She tells him what he has is enough for now, and he should just leave it there, and she doesn't want to jump ahead of his teacher's plan. But he says he's just curious to know, and he won't disturb the plan. That kind of curiosity about future lessons is very unusual among children in the government school. Their daily lessons are already overloaded; they have no curiosity about what comes next."
,"KESSP7,8",Q2 2018,KESS,Indirect B,"Personal, Relationships","Self-confidence, empathy, but mostly unclear",Story,"She (the mother) confesses that she has a short temper. But after seeing the children develop in this way she's learning to be more patient with them, and indeed more patient in general. Her son’s personality is always changing. In grade 1, he was always teasing and annoying the other kids, but as he’s gotten older he doesn't do that so much. He still struggles with his studies, and had to repeat grade 4, following the recommendation of his teacher. Even so, he's very insightful and socially adept. While he was initially ashamed to repeat a grade, he's doing very well now and has learned from his failures. One day at school they took nominations from the children about who should serve in a leadership role, and he got a lot of votes from everyone. He was surprised about this, because he didn't think of himself in this way. But it’s clear that others recognise his leadership abilities."
,"KESSP7,8",Q2 2018,KESS,Indirect B,Personal,Unclear,Story,"Her neighbours often come to her house to visit, and bring their kids. Her grade 3 daughter once started to draw a picture in front of the other kids, and as she was drawing the picture she started to tell a story about what was going on in it. Then she ran out of space to draw, but continued to tell her story just from the thoughts in her head, and the other children just sat watching her, rapt. The other parents were also amazed, that someone could do something like this, just follow her imagination on the spot. The things that other children know come from memorizing and repeating, not inventing like that."
,KESST3,Q2 2018,KESS,Indirect A,"Personal, Relationships","Peaceable, curious, mostly unclear","Story, but unsubstantiated","As teachers, we’ve benefited a lot from being involved in this program.It’s helped us change our mind-set; we see the same things occurring with the students. We’ve also seen some examples where changes in the students led to broader change within families, too. For example, I had a student who attended the government school but then switched to our school. At first he was very rude, he would even hit the teachers. Later, after he got used to the daily routine, his behaviour improved and he stopped disturbing the other children. He was about 6 or 7 at the time. I noticed him change within about 3 or 4 months. His parents noticed this too, because they said to me: 'Oh, he actually wants to go to school now.' They mentioned that it used to be hard to get him to go to school, when he was going to government school."
,KESST3,Q2 2018,KESS,Indirect A ,"Personal, Relationships","Communication, direct, but a bit unclear ",Story but unsubstantiated,"At first, I was angry easily. I couldn't control my temper. When I felt angry I showed it immediately. In this program they provide PLD. And I was able to slowly put away that mind-set. It’s still a struggle, and it’s something I've been working on for a few years now. Improved communication between colleagues, and with students has helped me to become more patient.If you asked my family about how I’ve changed, they might say something about the education program. My family were always traditional in how they thought about education, and initially they didn't accept these new community schools. But after a while they realised the good that was coming from it, and then came to accept it.My family had trouble accepting the child-centered approach, meaning that we didn't beat the students and that they didn't have exams. They said, ""Oh, how can you possibly teach anyone anything that way?"" But as I explained it to them, little by little, they came to accept it over the years."
,KESST3,Q2 2018,KESS,Indirect A ,"Personal, Relationships","Empathy, pride, but a bit unclear ",Story,"Usually when we were at school, taking exams for example, we would always memorize things by heart. In our school, we ask our students to write something as a kind of test, but we didn't call it a test. We just asked them to write about their family. So the title was: ""My family."" When I was in school I would have written, ""My father and mother are so-and-so, I have this many brothers and sisters, etc"". Just reporting standard facts. But this one student of mine wrote about the real situation in her family. ""Our toilet is broken, and my uncle just arrived from Mandalay. All the family members are working for my school fees,"". She also wrote about her own inner feelings. It made me very proud.The students are more self-reflective now. This enables them to work with people even when they don't fully agree with them, because they value their partner's perspective. Gov’t schools don't do that kind of thing."
,KESST3,Q2 2018,KESS,Indirect A,"Personal, Relationships",Unclear,Story,"There have been too many good times as a teacher. When I'm in a good mood, I feel like I have a lot to give. One example is from last year at the science fair, which was also our Christmas party. The children’s behaviour that day was normal for us, because we see this every day. But the parents came to join us, and were actually shocked to see how good the children were at explaining their work. We got a lot of this kind of feedback from parents, which made me feel very happy. They’d never seen this kind of program in their village before. When they asked the children questions, they responded to them confidently."
,KESST3,Q2 2018,KESS,Indirect A,Personal,"Candid, unreserved, otherwise unclear","Story, but unsubstantiated","At first I used to just make general points in meetings. I used not to talk about what shouldn't be done, but now I've learned to be clearer about boundaries. It's also now only more recently that I talk to them individually and privately, which I didn't use to do. Sometime teachers will come very late without letting me know, or even each other. It gave me a headache to think about how to deal with them.I ask for the reasons, explain the effects to the class. Some reasons are good, some reasons are bad, but they should at least let people know. And then we may also set new rules in the next meeting."
,KESSP9,Q2 2018,KESS/NS,Direct ,"Personal, Relationships",Story,,"My niece, my sister's daughter, moved to town from China a few years ago. She was quite rude at first. Sometimes she would run away from home, and go to sleep in the forest. But after going to the community school her behavior has much improved. She started to behave well. She seems to love attending the school. She never wants to miss a day. She's able to express love to family members now, like she made a gift for her grandmother and said she loved her, which is something she never did before."
,KESSP10/11*,Q2 2018,KESS/NS,Indirect,Community,Story,,"The differences between children from government school and community school are visible only within the family. He sees children from government schools just do what they are told. But his child in the community school, always ask ""Why?"" They want to understand, not just follow orders. One specific example is that his daughter got involved with their discussion when they were trying to build out the sewer drains that run out from their house to the street. The daughter piped up to point out that this sort of construction really needed to involve an expert who knows the city system, and it's not just something for people to try and do for themselves in a haphazard way. "
,KESSP10/11*,Q2 2018,KESS/NS,Indirect,Personal,Scenario,,"My decision to send my son to government school was based on the fact that the curriculum is already completed, the school system is a known quantity, stable, has resources, the community school teachers are new and relatively unskilled, and beyond all that the government school is free. It just seemed more prudent. But then I changed my mind again for the youngest. I am starting to see the differences in his children, and why the community school is valuable. "
,KESSP12,Q2 2018,KESS/NS,Indirect,"Personal, Community",Story,,"In the music camp, there were many participants from government schools, and even university students older than my son who is grade 5 community student including his older sister. Nobody dare to speak up, or lead a group prayer, or lead as a chairperson to lead a worship session. But my son dared to do that, and he spoke out very clearly in front of the others."
,KESSP12,Q2 2018,KESS/NS,Indirect,"Personal, Relationships",Story,,"One time my son caused a problem with some of his friends, and when I heard about it, it made me very angry. And I grabbed up a stick and ran out to beat him. But he cried out, ""Wait! Wait! Tell me what I did wrong first, at least! If you're going to beat me, beat me, but give me a reason!"" It made her stop and think, and she realized he was right. If the punishment wasn't linked to an instructive purpose, it was just empty violence. I also learned to know one’s limit and to appreciate it, from my son’s self-awareness. Like he says that he's good at languages, but not good at maths. "
,KESSP12,Q2 2018,KESS/NS,Indirect,"Personal, Relationships",Story,,"I used to beat the older ones a lot, when they were younger. I would even take out my frustrations on them, and beat them not because of something they did but because of something I was upset about in my own life. Later I realized I needed to change my parenting. It is not because of the school or the program, but I read some parenting books, books on child psychology, and talked with other educated parents about how they raise their children. Finally my eyes were opened, and I decided not to beat my youngest two children in the same way. I can see now that my oldest child and youngest child are very different as a result. The oldest one doesn't have any ambition, but the youngest one seems very self-driven. My youngest daughter once overheard the piano teacher praised her brother, and so then she started to wake up very early and practiced piano harder, until she could earn the teacher's praise. I never saw that kind of drivenness in my oldest daughter. I think this is because of the excessive punishment, and I feel guilty about that. I told my oldest daughter that when she was young she got very sick, and that's why she's a slow learner. But secretly I am afraid it's my own fault."
,KESSP13/14,Q2 2018,KESS/NS,Indirect,"Personal, Community","Story, Scenario",,"My youngest daughter who attends the community school is more self-directed, and doesn't need extra coaching from her mother while the two older ones need more pushing to do their studies. Her two oldest daughters don't dare to give their opinions or suggestions. But the youngest one speaks very openly about her own ideas. Her older sisters tell her this is rude. My youngest daughter can pray with her own words, but her brother who attends government school can't, and just copies what his sister says. Or when it comes to writing essays. She had to write an essay about a cat one time. So she sat and looked at the cat, and tried to write how she saw it behave, not just the book explanation on cats."
,KESSP13/14,Q2 2018,KESS/NS,Indirect,Personal,Story,,"My daughter sometimes questions about Jinghpaw language that we did not know. So I learn these from their children. In the community school, they have a news sharing time. If the parents do not behave well at home, their children will talk about them during the morning routine (e.g. my parents were shouting at each other last night). Therefore I have to be careful of my behaviors. "
,KESSP15,Q2 2018,KESS/NS,Indirect,Personal/family,"Story, Scenario",,"This past year the mother has had health problems that keep her from working as much as she wants to support the children. The youngest daughter actually volunteered to leave the community school and go to government school in order to reduce the financial burden. But the mother insisted that she continue. Some weeks ago the mother's health problems worsened, and she had very sharp pains in her legs, like something was chewing on her bones, and that left her bedridden. The children were all crying to see her in that state. The youngest daughter was also crying at first, but then roused herself and said that instead of crying she should go pray and the mother saw that as a strong sign both of her maturity and faith in God. The daughter also said she wished she could give her legs to her mother, to take away the pain. "
,KESST1,Q2 2018,KESS/NS,Direct?,"Personal,community",Story,,"I used to be so shy, and wasn't confident to speak. But I practice in front of the children, and they trust me, and it gives me the strength to speak out in front of the parents. Last year in June, at the start of the school year, we had a meeting where all the parents were invited. And my school principal asked me to say something to the parents. So I spent all night writing down how I thought the parents could be involved, and the next morning I shared stories about things between the students and me, or how they are improving, and how the parents should support it, things they could do at home. School also makes us more social. "
,KESST1,Q2 2018,KESS/NS,Direct?,"Personal,community",Story,,"I was always a good follower. Learned from the leaders. I am an assistant principal. In the last December, the teachers and students wanted to have a Christmas gathering with another community school (Dima school). Our school principal wasn’t present at school at that time. As an assistant principal, I went to inform the school committee after we had discussed and had agreed plans with Dima school. The reply I got from the school committee was, ""this is not your school. You don't just get to decide these things on your own. You should have come to us first."" Within the church culture, sending an official letter from the church if having activities with another church is a protocol. But for me, this is not a church activity but the school activity. I felt I was scolded very badly. The other teachers were about to give up, but when I looked at the very excited students, and all the preparation work we were doing, like making presents and decorations, I decided to go anyway. So I went back to the school committee and confronted that, ""this is not a church activity. This is our school activity. It's even in the curriculum. Even if you don't approve, we are going.” Finally, the school committee gave permission with a warning not to do like this again. "
,KESST2,Q2 2018,KESS/NS,Direct?,Community,Scenario,,"I imagined a future where we did get a good education, and it seemed worth trying for. We still have so many invisible threats from the government, and they have so many operations against us. Not only us but also other ethnic groups. And other groups are also starting to make their own education systems as well. Actually, we weren't sure how the government would respond. But we do know that the education we were otherwise getting was useless, and made us feel inferior. They treated us like we were a slow, backward and uncivilized people. So we had to do something. "
