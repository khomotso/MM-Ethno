DFS1,Q2 2018,"personal, family, community",Story,2.5,2,2,,,"Listening, dialogue","I come from a long line of soldiers in my family, stretching back generations. Even though I am a woman, I used to have a reputation for being a stern and domineering person. Even my husband was a little afraid of me, I think, and took more responsibility with housework while I went out doing my training work with the KNU. I was a teacher, but my style of teaching was more like a drill-sergeant. People didn't tend to seek me out for advice; if anything, they avoided me. I made my first Bamar friend in the DF training, we've become quite close, and I think that's had a big effect on me. These days, I'm surprised to find that people are always waiting to have conversations with me: family members and also other administrators from around the area. I'll come back from delivering a training, and someone or some group will be sitting there waiting to talk to me. I ask them why, and they say that even though I don't always know their situation well, that when they discuss it with me they find answers for themselves."
DFS1,Q2 2018,Colleagues,Story  ,3,1,2,,,Collaboration; organizational behavior,"The Karen want to find political solutions through political negotiations. So we must have facilitators, who could facilitate for all these people to speak up. So that’s why we gathered together a few of us from the different DF cohorts, and formed what we call the 'Karen Facilitation Group.' It's a professional society that can help bring the needed skills to this process. We are now asked to facilitate all the internal KNU meetings, so our leadership has also recognized our value. It is not only for Karen society, it is also good for the broader society."
DFS1,Q2 2018,Community,Story ,2.5,1,2,,,"governance, dialogue, ethnic conflict","I give awareness training for conflict transformation and the concept of dialogue culture in the frontline areas where the KNU soldiers are fighting. I went to work with one brigade on the front lines, and I now see ways in which their patterns even within their own ranks are changing. They used to have a lot of internal fighting, for example, as members of different religious and ethnic sub-groups become hostile to one another. Sometimes even to the point of shooting at one another. The leaders would treat these issues with harsh punishment, like putting the soldiers in stocks for days on end. But now they seem to have internalized the idea that prisoners have rights, and that having a forum for people to talk through their complaints before it reaches the level of violence can be a better way to manage things. Because of this progress, I think that there should be more of this training, dialogue training, with different brigades – not just on the KNU side, but also on the Tatmadaw side. I have strong reason to hope that if we can give this sort of awareness training, then we can reduce the level of fighting."
DFS12,Q2 2018,"Personal, family, community",story,2.5,2,1.5,,,"challenging authority, self-direction","I grew up in a village close to the KNU-controlled areas. I have always had a lame leg, and people have called me a cripple all my life. But I was good in school, was one of the few in my village who passed matric, and so I learned to be an accountant. My family was pleased with this, until I started to take on pro bono work in order to help the community. Once they became so upset that I wasn't doing more to earn money, that my parents beat me. But I pressed on. I joined a DF bootcamp a couple years ago, and there met an older woman who has become a kind of role model for me. More recently I've been elected as a village administrator - the youngest administrator in the village's history. "
DFS12,Q2 2018,Community,"
",2.5,2,1,,,"recognizing patterns, exploitation","There is a problem regarding land ownership in our village. It’s actually not hard to officially claim ownership of your ancestor’s land, but a former village administrator did not inform villagers of their rights in this area, so that many of them simply did not know they could apply. This administrator in fact took some of this land for himself, without notifying those who had a claim to it. This former administrator is no longer in that position of authority – he’s an ordinary villager now. But there is still a problem going on between these villagers. So in that scenario, I helped them see the repetitions, the patterns, of all the sorts of problems, by using the timeline tool. So they can see how this kind of problem repeats along the history. I've now been elected a village administrator."
DFS12,Q2 2018,Personal,Scenario ,1,1,1,,,"Self-awareness, building trust","Before I joined DF actually I had some trainings on facilitation. But when I joined DF program, it built up the ideas from the fundamentals, and so really deepened my understanding. For example, in the past, when there are going to be facilitations or events, we just jump in and are doing facilitations based on the agendas developed by others. After joining DF, I came to see that before we facilitate others, we have to facilitate ourselves first. For example, you have to build your trust level and the way you behave, all your manners, so that if these people are going to be facilitated by me, those people will see me as a trustworthy person. For example, sometimes you got involved in the discussions of the participants, and you forget that you are facilitating them, so you have to be always aware that you are facilitating them, not to get too dragged along by the participants. So you have to be always aware."
DFS2,Q2 2018,"Personal, Colleagues",Scenario ,1,1,1,,,"Self-control, listening, dialogue, organizational behavior","Before PLD, when we had meetings in our organizations we discussed based on emotions alone. After PLD, I can manage myself better, and I can better understand how other people think and feel the way they do. And I can find better ways to resolve our discussions. Before our discussions were rather short - we vented our feelings, and there wasn't any space to work things through. The attitude was 'take it or leave it.' Now our discussions are long. We take time to understand the motivations on all sides, their concerns, etc."
DFS2,Q2 2018,"Personal, Community",Scenario ,1.5,1,1,,,"Objectivity, self-control, planning, process","Coal miners are deeply affected by government policies and agencies in their area, and they came to us to explain their plight with great feeling. I listened to them, but then tried to explain that deep feeling will not be enough to change the situation: we need to talk with information. We need to ask ourselves, is this real information, or just feelings? We need to be aware of this in order to be effective in conversations with the government committees. We need to plan around this. So we discussed how to control their mindsets and make their case objectively. We worked through some examples together. They get it now. Our project activity is for multi-stakeholder meetings for two months. They can now collect information and they can discuss formally, control their emotions, and hit the target. They can now also see these discussions are an ongoing process, not a one-time event. It's not one shot, one target. It needs a steady barrage."
DFS3,Q2 2018,"Personal, Community",Story ,1.5,1,2,,,"Technical support, confidence, creativity","ROAD is working on some projects and sometimes we need to give trainings. The curriculum was developed locally, but the values and theories I got from the DF program. Conflict transformation theory, for example, or deliberative dialogue theory -- I got these from DF. I based my trainings from these old theories while adapting them to match the local context. Before the DF program I didn’t have the confidence, and not enough motivation, but after the DF program I had both the confidence and the motivation to set up ROAD."
DFS3,Q2 2018,Personal,Scenario ,1.5,2,1,,,"self-awareness, self-control, forgiveness, trust","People who have known me for a long time say that my whole posture toward other people has changed. I was once a very young member of the 88 generation protesters, which was a traumatic experience: I was betrayed, my parents and I were imprisoned, assaulted, all kinds of things. I always tended to be an emotional person anyway, very sensitive. And so then I became very bitter and untrusting as well. I developed a reputation for never smiling. Forgiveness has been a real struggle. I would really hate those who didn't show me respect. But now, after a long while, I feel I'm finally able to let go of that. People who knew me in the past have told me they are surprised by this big change in me."
DFS4,Q2 2018,"Personal, Community",Story ,1,0,0,,,"Local government, Listening, Dialogue","Over the last six months I have been involved with organizing the election process for a new village head. I wasn't there in any official capacity, just as another village member expressing their views. I listened to what was being said in the forums, shared some of what I've learned, and found that I was starting to play a facilitating role without intending to. The existing administrator was conflicted about whether it was legitimate for him to run again for the office or not. His thinking wasn't clear, and there was some confusion about how to proceed. That’s where I got involved. My contribution came directly from what I learned from DF. I listened, I asked questions. For example, would people accept it if this existing head ran for office again? These kinds of things. I don’t know exactly how it's going to turn out, but one early outcome is that the existing administrator has indeed decided to stand for election again. I feel I played a part in that."
DFS5,Q2 2018,Community,Story ,1.5,1.5,2,,,"Dialogue, strategic planning, community organizing, building trust","This one community had been having a problem with the Myanmar-China pipeline for four years. A number of the villagers had their farms destroyed by the pipeline construction and water erosion. So the farmers sought compensation. The Chinese company claimed it was not their fault. And the discussions went nowhere for four years. So I went and talked with the people using appreciative inquiry, and I used some strategic planning approaches to diagram who was involved, who needed to be approached, things like that. I made one statement with all the community and applied to the Hluttaw. I collected everyone’s concerns to put to the Hluttaw, so that the community could get compensation. In the end they got 40,000 lakhs compensation."
DFS5,Q2 2018,"Personal, Community",Story ,2,1,2,,,"Community organizing, inclusion, initiative","Before I had been working with the Farmer’s Union, but I became interested in environmental issues, including things like the pipeline. There was a big flood in December of 2015, and I went to work on the rescue team. It was while working on that team that I had an idea that these people need a place to talk about finding solutions to their issues, so I created a Community Dialogue Centre, and built it next to my house. A bamboo shelter, so people can come and talk to find solutions, this type of thing. I contacted Metta Development Foundation, got a loan for this project, and built up from there. Now the situation is that twice a year we have a big village committee meeting, go over financial statements and other information about what is going on environmentally in their area - erosion, diseases, improvements, etc - they bring it all. And we talk through it together."
DFS5,Q2 2018,Family ,Story ,1.5,1,1,,,"Community respect, social pressure","During the DF training I was struggling with my family because they didn't believe in this kind of work. They didn't take it seriously, because I wasn't getting any money out of it. But now that they can see how the community trusts me, how they visit our home to seek my advice – my family has been impressed by this, and now supports me."
DFS6,Q2 2018,Personal,Story ,1.5,1,0,,,"self-direction, greed","The main change in me is that I am less greedy than I was before. I remember the phrase ‘Go slow, to go first’ from DF. Now I can say No, when I need to say No, and focus on my values first and foremost. For example, after DF I was offered a job as a freelance trainer and facilitator, which wouldn’t have been an all-inclusive process involving other groups in the region. In the past I would have done it purely for the money. But after DF I saw the bigger picture and realized it wouldn’t align with my own values. For that reason I rejected the job offer."
DFS6,Q2 2018,"family, community",Story ,1.5,1,2,,,"Community organizing, listening, inclusion","One of my main achievements has been facilitating and organizing meetings within my own tribal community. We have six different families within this community. Most of them have moved away from the region for their career/business. Yet we all still dreamed to stay close together in the same town or close by. Thanks to DF, I decided to make a plan to bring the community closer again - I designed and strategized a process, a long process. I called each family frequently to explain and also let my parents talk to each respective parent. I organized a community gathering around in order to have a dialogue about our desires to be closer, in which I facilitated a decision-making process. I shared my difficulties and gave time to listen all of the families and facilitated part of the dialogue through a narrative practice, which included a timeline of tribal history in my community. As a result, four of the tribal families are living in same town and the other two will move closer to us in the near future."
DFS6,Q2 2018,Community,Story ,2.5,1,2,,,"dialogue, community organizing, women's issues","I organized a support group for women in my church to openly have dialogue and discussions about current issues affecting them, such as parenting issues, drug issues, etc. I used the circle process in order for each person to have an equal chance to talk and practice how to listen. In my training, I do not control or force the participants into following my methods; I just facilitated the circle process so that more ideas and thoughts would develop. It feels good to have done this and it has created a more relaxing and equal space for the women participants, and they even continue the circle process to this day, even when I am not present."
DFS7,Q2 2018,Colleagues,Story ,3,2,2,,,"organizational behavior, dialogue, breaking convention","At the beginning of the National Dialogue process, the KNU thought that facilitation was just like being a secretary, taking notes, writing flip charts, etc. It took some time to convince them that facilitation had a role to play in developing the agenda in the first place. They didn't trust us to help with this in the beginning. But little by little, one even at a time, we started to demonstrate our value and the contribution we could make to process design. After finishing the first official event of the Karen ""Ethnic-based National Dialogue,"" and then carrying on with the National Dialogue, they realized they needed to establish a strong facilitation team. They came to appreciate this form of professional skill, and it was no longer good enough to just randomly call together meetings, as had been their habit. These days they invite us to facilitate even their smaller team meetings, not just the big events. This is how much the culture of the organization has changed - they want us to play a role at every level."
DFS7,Q2 2018,Community,Story  ,3,2,2,,,"Power dynamics, dialogue, local governance, creativity, marginalized voices, breaking convention","Discussions between between the EAO leaders and villagers, when they come together at the village hall, can be awkward affairs. The EAOs are powerful, their leaders sit in front, they give some briefing or even instructions, and the ordinary villagers are intimidated into silence, even when they have a real issue to raise. So we came up with an idea to bring these issues to the surface. We set up some little bowls on tables, one for the KNU, one for the village administrator, etc. And putting a note in the bowl was a way to speak up and give a message to a leader. After lunch we would read these out, and ask the leaders to respond. Some issues could get resolved there on the spot, and some needed time before the leaders could respond, but at least these things were recognized and handled in a way that they wouldn't be before. In one meeting, for example, the community raised the issue of ""taxation."" Taxation in this context means that the EAOs collect money from the communities. The community in this instance thought that the taxation amount was too high, but they were afraid to make this point. So at one meeting our bowls helped them raise this issue. At the meeting were not only low-level officers, but also higher-level officers. At the time the higher level officers said ""Oh, we didn’t know about that, we have a standard rate for that."" So they started an inquiry right there to get to the bottom of it, right in public. They asked the lower level officers to clarify. In the end it was agreed that villagers should keep receipts as evidence, and complaints could be submitted to the head office. This new way of handling complaints was a constructive outcome of one of our facilitated meetings."
DFS7,Q2 2018,Community,Scenario ,2.5,1,2,,,"Power dynamics, facilitation, listening","At the community level, even in the national dialogue, most of the people are coming from the village or township level. In such settings you'll often see a few dominant speakers, 3 or 4, while the rest of the community members just sit silently. But when we have a chance to facilitate with a group discussion we are able to balance out that type of situation with some ground rules. We make sure everyone to has a chance to have a say."
DFS8,Q2 2018,Community,Scenario ,2.5,1,2,,,"Listening, breaking convention, leadership, bottom-up approach","It’s not only mind-set change: it’s leadership. Before we were just acting on orders from above. Now our project is based on what the community wants to build, not what the department wants. Now we think for ourselves more, and when we are doing our duty we do it with kindness for the people we work together with. Also listening, instead of saying lots of things, we give more of our time for listening to what the community is saying to us. For these reasons, relations have developed and are getting better and better."
DFS9,July 2018,Community,Story ,2.5,1,2,,,"Process improvement, organizational behavior, facilitation skill","I was part of the team that designed dialogue processes and did the facilitation for the Karen National Dialogues and regional national dialogues in the Karen state and other regions,. Working in the Karen state was fine, since the KNU gave us the necessary authority for developing processes and facilitation. But, working in other regions (e.g. Bago) the influence of the regional government made it difficult. In fact, the conveners didn't even have a clear goal or purpose for their dialogue. At the pre-meeting we members of the facilitation team and the conveners had a huge argument over this, and how the dialogue should be conducted. Finally we were able to make our points, we explained what facilitation really is (not just note-taking, like they seemed to believe), why it's needed, etc., and they finally relented. Then in the midst of the dialogue we had other issues. Some members were really obstinate about having their views retained, for example, even though we had voting methods to prioritize or demote different viewpoints that not everyone shared, this wasn't always accepted. We had to use many of the different tools we learned in DF to navigate these situations, like the 'Wheel' method and 'Chalk Talk' for small groups. In the end we felt we had some partial success with the published policy papers, but part of what I learned is that we really have to be more careful about laying out the ground rules ahead of time, and getting everyone to agree to them."
DFS9,July 2018,"Personal, community",Story ,2.5,2,2,,,"dialogue, empathy, listening, generation gap","I was invited to facilitate a dialogue between the young and the old in my church in order to bridge the divide between them. I set up a three stage process: first, the two groups will share their views about one another in a large group; secondly, two groups would be divided and each will contain both young and old participants – one group will think like the young, and another like the old. The reason behind is that those young people who were in the group that was supposed to think like the old had to develop empathy for the old, and those old people vice versa; thirdly, the two groups will be combined and share their views and develop a sense of mutual understanding among them. So, although this is just a small process, it shows how I'm now thinking from process perspectives – how to structure the conversation so that the purpose (what) is best achieved."
DFS10,July 2018,Personal,Story ,2.5,2,1,,,"self-direction, courage, listening","The biggest change in my life following DF has been that I've made a major career change, and I credit DF with enabling me to do this. I had been appointed as a school teacher, which my family forced me to accept at the time, since they thought government service was a good and stable situation. My parents in particular twisted my arm. I went along with it, since I do like children, but at the same time some part of me felt that teaching was too limiting. After doing the DF program I felt that I had found my calling. I think the thing I find most compelling about it is that when I facilitate I'm not teaching people, not trying to instruct them. Instead I'm listening and learning from them, and we come together in that way. So after this I felt emboldened to make my own choice, despite strong pressure from my family, and chose to leave my teaching appointment and take a risk on making facilitation my career."
DFS10,July 2018,Community,Story ,1.5,1,1,,,"Listening, community organizing, group support","The organization I work for has always done a lot of awareness training for women, on issues like women's rights, consumer rights, land rights, environmental protection, income generation, etc. But after DF I started to feel that didn't go deep enough, because it was just instructing the women and not really listening to them. So on my own initiative I tried to leave more room to listen to the women, hear their issues, and think about practical ways we could support each other. In the past I felt that the women only seemed to come grudgingly, didn't engage or left early, and we couldn't get them to make time to meet together very often. But now we get together weekly, and more of them are active, so I feel like this new approach has really been valuable."
DFS11,July 2018,"Personal, Family",Story ,1.5,1,1,,,"Self-awareness, self-control, violence, empathy","I had a terrible relationship with my mother in law for the longest time. My own parents passed away earlier, and so my husband and I lived with my mother-in-law. She would complain about me or do things to question or undermine me, and I would often lose my temper. In fact, there were even times when I beat her physically. I think I even had a reputation in our neighborhood for being a bad daughter-in-law. It was obvious to everyone. But after the DF training, I think my mind opened a little bit to seeing her perspective, and I started to recognize how her motivation really came from a place of love and concern for her son, not really hostility to me. Change hasn't happened quickly - it's been 2 years that I've been trying to change my behavior at home - but I think we now appreciate each other, and I no longer lose my temper with her."
DFS11,July 2018,Personal,perspective,2.5,2,2,,,"New insight, connection between spiritual and professional, breaking convention","I had done some facilitation training in other contexts, but DF really changed my whole conception of what it meant. I used to think it was just about asking clarifying questions and synthesizing reports, for example, but DF showed me it was also about compassion and patience. Or the kind of reflection we saw in PLD seemed to me like the kind of thing you might use at the temple or for your spiritual life, but I came to recognize that it could support my professional life as well."
DFS13,November 2018,"personal, family",story,,,,,,,"I am familiar with facilitation because I was an intern at an educational institution. My seniors from DF(1) introduced this program to me and I was interested. At first, I was curious on how it would start with techniques, tools, or theories but I was surprised to start out with PLD. I didn’t know PLD but I fell in love with the teaching that if you want world peace, it has to start with yourself. Before, I was only taught the techniques, tools, and guidance. We didn’t realize to reflect on ourselves. My parents are farmers in a village and run a small store at home. We’re a very peaceful family, and my parents wanted me to work at a government run facility and stay at home mostly. I wanted to do my own thing so I came to the city. I thought I was doing the right thing so I didn’t try to discuss or come to an understanding with my parents. But, this program has taught me to facilitate myself before I try to do it for anyone else. So, I decided to go home and communicate with my parents. I listened to what they had to say and I opened up to them on what I wanted to do and what I wanted to be. My father became an important person in the village. When people of different thinking cannot come to a middle ground and come to my father for advice, I advised him to use tools and techniques of facilitation. He would help them get to the core of what they both really want and focus on it. He facilitated them to listen to each other and respect the differences. He trusts and understands me on the path I’m walking now. The relationship between me and my family has become better and stronger. Before, we had our backs turned on each other, not giving a chance to listen, discuss, or understand each other. Now, my parents have accepted my choice of career path, supported me, and I have become someone they can be proud of."
DFS14,November 2018,,story,,,,,,,"I’m a leader of Development and Resource Organization in the Southern Shan state. I joined this program because DAI reached out to me.  I heard about the program only briefly and it caught my attention. From the start, I saw that it was a unique program and nothing like the others I’ve joined before. I fell in love with how PLD has taught me to reflect on myself for peace. We have a militia group in the region, and they collect donation money from 5 villages, making some pay 260,000 kyats and some up to 350,000 kyats a month. The village leaders came to our organization and asked for help. I thought maybe I should go on media, go to the government for help, or if I should meet someone from authority. I decided to go talk to the leader and negotiate, so I set an appointment. I proposed a reduction in donation money for the villagers. The leader was surprised and taken aback. It turned out he didn’t know about the demanding nature of the donations. It was just the members who made it up and asked for money. The leader then told the villagers that they didn’t have to pay anymore and apologized on behalf of his members. He told the villagers to come to him if this happens again in the future. For me, this is a great change. I handled this situation very well because of the lessons on conflict and solution from the program. If I had went on media or to the government like I would have done in the past, it would have caused more problems and danger for the villagers. I have decided to use the lessons I got from this program on conflicts, events and meetings. Now that I know the process and role of a facilitator, I can arrange the CSO peace forum better."
DFS15,November 2018,,story,,,,,,,"Encouraged by a senior, Ko Htun Aung from DF (3), I joined this program. I saw it was different from other programs. Though everyone came from different regions and states, we established a middle ground very quickly. What I liked most was how the teachers and students acted like a family and a welcoming community (Usually, the teacher would stay on his own after lecturing). I really liked that we started with PLD, and because of that, I have no doubts for my ability to go on until the end the program. Instead, I was motivated to go on until the end. We have some militia groups at our region. We work together as business partners and they’re my friends, but there are some things they do that I don’t like. They would ask for money from the villagers and if they couldn’t, they would cause trouble for them, like burning their houses down. This program has helped me come up with ways to talk to them. I tried to understand them and asked questions like if they asked for money because they wanted to help the villagers or just for power. Slowly, their way of thinking changed and now, they only collect the money if it was paid willingly, without forcing them or threatening them. I have become more confident with the skills I got from this program and I use them whenever I am given the chance to."
DFS16,November 2018,"personal, community",story,,,,,,,"I started out as a volunteer for a project done by a senior from DF-3. Then, I joined the program myself. I’ve always wanted to have a youth forum on educational discussions. Now that I have the knowledge that I got from this program on facilitating, I decided to bring it into action. I went to Mon State Education Department for permission, and then went on to different education departments and Township information and Administration department to have this event. With the help of my colleagues from DF-4 and Hope International Development Agency, the event was successful. Not only did I get good feedbacks from the guests saying how they enjoyed having an open discussion and all their ideas are now put together in education departments, but this event was also requested from several other townships.  In the future, I would like to have more forums for youths on different topics like drug abuse or employment. This program has not only given me guidance, but it has also given me confidence."
