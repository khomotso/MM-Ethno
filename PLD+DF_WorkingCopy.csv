1,"Community, Colleagues",Shallow,,Weak,"organizational behavior, quality discussion","There was a recent time when the government, working with some Chinese businesses, tried to take over some of the land vacated by IDPs in order to set up a banana plantation. The church association I lead had to work to try to mobilize the people to resist this, but do so with a community obviously distributed widely and under threat, and yet without things spilling over into yet another episode of hostilities. My staff had to do a lot of work to organize people, and I think some of the communication skills we learned through PLD helped us manage this in a way that I think we simply couldn't have 2 years ago."
2,Community,Shallow,,Strong ,"Quality discussion, strategic planning, community organizing, gaining trust","This one community had been having a problem with the Myanmar-China pipeline for four years. A number of the villagers had their farms destroyed by the pipeline construction and water erosion. So the farmers sought compensation. The Chinese company claimed it was not their fault. And the discussions went nowhere for four years. So I went and talked with the people using appreciative inquiry, and I used some strategic planning approaches to diagram who was involved, who needed to be approached, things like that. I made one statement with all the community and applied to the Hluttaw. I collected everyone’s concerns to put to the Hluttaw, so that the community could get compensation. In the end they got 40,000 lakhs compensation."
3,Community,Moderate,,Strong,"Community organizing, inclusion, initiative","Before I had been working with the Farmer’s Union, but I became interested in environmental issues, including things like the pipeline. There was a big flood in December of 2015, and I went to work on the rescue team. It was while working on that team that I had an idea that these people need a place to talk about finding solutions to their issues, so I created a Community Dialogue Centre, and built it next to my house. A bamboo shelter, so people can come and talk to find solutions, this type of thing. I contacted Metta Development Foundation, got a loan for this project, and built up from there. Now the situation is that twice a year we have a big village committee meeting, go over financial statements and other information about what is going on environmentally in their area - erosion, diseases, improvements, etc - they bring it all. And we talk through it together."
4,"Personal, Community",Shallow,,Moderate,"Listening, Quality discussion, self-awareness","Over the last six months I have been involved with organizing the election process for a new village head. I wasn't there in any official capacity, just as another village member expressing their views. I listened to what was being said in the forums, shared some of what I've learned, and found that I was starting to play a facilitating role without intending to. The existing administrator was conflicted about whether it was legitimate for him to run again for the office or not. His thinking wasn't clear, and there was some confusion about how to proceed. That’s where I got involved. My contribution came directly from what I learned from DF. I listened, I asked questions. For example, would people accept it if this existing head ran for office again? These kinds of things. I don’t know exactly how it's going to turn out, but one early outcome is that the existing administrator has indeed decided to stand for election again. I feel I played a part in that."
5,Community,Moderate,,Weak,"Listening, community organizing","The organization I work for has always done a lot of awareness training for women, on issues like women's rights, consumer rights, land rights, environmental protection, income generation, etc. But after DF I started to feel that didn't go deep enough, because it was just instructing the women and not really listening to them. So on my own initiative I tried to leave more room to listen to the women, hear their issues, and think about practical ways we could support each other. In the past I felt that the women only seemed to come grudgingly, didn't engage or left early, and we couldn't get them to make time to meet together very often. But now we get together weekly, and more of them are active, so I feel like this new approach has really been valuable."
6,"Personal, Colleagues",Moderate,,Weak,"leadership, listening, organizational behavior, controlling others","Before the PLD work I used to be preoccupied with status and power. As a religious leader in my association I used my power in a top-down way, and had no interest in listening to my subordinates. No longer. I feel I have a strong relationship with my colleagues now. I listen more and try to understand other points of view. One of my biggest realizations in PLD was how people create problems by trying to control others. Now I've learned to focus on changing myself first.  My leadership style has changed from top-down to bottom up. Which means I listen more, and I encourage my fellow church village members to find their own voice. With all these changes to how I approach the people around me, I find that I am more content and stress free."
7,"Personal, Family",Moderate,,Weak,"power dynamics, gender roles, appreciation, listening, quality discussion","I used to be impatient with my family members. I used to dominate everything as the leading man of the household, and think that was my proper role. But now I think I show my appreciation to my wife and my kids. It seems to me that the trust between us is growing. I believe this because I can see that we are taking more time to talk about things and consult each other, rather than having them hide their opinions because they're afraid of being criticized. We simply never took this kind of discussion time in my family before."
8,Personal,Moderate,,Weak,"questioning authority, self-awareness","PLD helped me realize that the messages we religious leaders delivered in our sermons were hollow, that in a way we were cheating our church members because we couldn't practice what we preach. For example we teach about love and forgiveness but we can’t even show love in our families or work settings. Sometimes we teach about the kingdom of God, but we don’t even have a clear concept of it. So it's forced me to confront deep and important questions about what I'm doing with my life."
9,"Personal, Community",Moderate,,Weak,"self-awareness, self-control, repairing relationships","After my parent’s death the members of the church showed me a lot of sympathy, but to an excessive degree, I felt, to the point that I started to resent the way their pity made me feel, like a victim. But after the second PLD process I reflected and asked myself why I’ve been allowing their actions to make me feel victimised. I learned that I can’t change their attitude, but I can change mine. So I started to try to go to church and look past the behavior that had been wounding me. After a time I could see their own behavior start to change, as I showed a new attitude, and now I have become one of the most reliable young people in my church. Now I have a very good relationship with leaders and the youth of the church."
10,"Personal, Family, Community",Moderate,,Strong,"courage, self-direction, social work, social pressure","I started a community youth centre in 2016. At that time my family faced financial difficulties, and they were not interested in social work. They pushed me to go abroad in order to make more money. But the reflective activities of the PLD process made me much clearer about what I really wanted to do. I started the centre without any money or previous experience, and my parents thought it was useless. I had a job but no salary. PLD helped build my confidence and motivated me to start doing this. Before I started the centre, my parents would usually order me around all the time. But now they don’t order me about or pressure me to do anything."
11,Personal,Moderate,,Strong,"self-direction, social pressure, courage, self-awareness","I used to work for a religious organization, but over time came to realize that this work was not compatible with my dreams. They told me I was selfish for wanting to leave, which stopped me from making this decision initially. But eventually I mustered the courage to follow my passions. I want to be involved in this transformation process for my whole life: it keeps me motivated, has allowed me to heal from issues that are causing me pain, and enables me to lead a peaceful and meaningful life. "
12,"Personal, Family",Moderate,,Strong,"self-direction, repairing relationships, courage","I’ve never been confident enough to make difficult decisions, and lacked the motivation to follow them through. But in 2016, I decided to leave my religious organisation. Without the transformation process, I couldn’t have made that decision.  I knew I needed more time to rebuild my relationship in my family (especially my mother), while at the same time I’ve always been interested in working on women’s issues, and my religious organization wasn't allowing enough room for me to make progress in either area. "
13,"Personal, Colleagues",Moderate,,Strong,"courage, repairing relationships, quality discussion, self-awareness, self-direction, blaming others","I once went to a Wa village to deliver seven days of training. My senior colleague told me he’d arrive the following day, but he didn't show up, and I had to start the training without him. I became ill, and as the village is in a remote area and is very poor; they only eat rice balls with no curry. My sickness grew and as the food was terrible, I had no energy and I wanted to give up. I decided during the training that I’d make a complaint to my colleague and then quit my job. Finally he arrived on the last day but I didn’t talk to him - instead the villagers told him about my struggles. On the drive back home I asked myself “what would be the use of complaining?” But I decided to talk with him frankly about how the situation affected me, without coming across as blaming. He then acknowledged the lack of conscientiousness he’d shown, and we were able to build an understanding through this conversation, which encouraged me to stay on. Now we are happily working together and he has learnt from his mistakes. I never used to be confident enough to voice my thoughts and take a stand."
14,Family,Moderate,,Strong,"violence, self-awareness, self-control","In 2014 I attended my first PLD during a summer education camp. I thought that PLD would have something to do with management, and I was wrong, but wanted to learn more. Although the ideas were appealing, I didn't really try to apply it in my life until I fell into a conflict with my stepmother over an inheritance. There was a moment when I even contemplated having my stepmother killed, I was so consumed with the desire to win. But then I started to recognize how my ego was in the driver's seat. It came to the point where I was faced with a choice of giving false testimony in court, and that's when I finally realized that my path did not align with my values. I changed course, didn't take that step of lying in court, and my stepmother won the case. I can't claim that we have a good relationship now, but I take some satisfaction from the fact that I controlled myself at the end."
15,Colleagues,Moderate,,Strong,"Organizational behavior, Quality discussions","At the beginning of the National Dialogue process, the KNU thought that facilitation was just like being a secretary, taking notes, writing flip charts, etc. It took some time to convince them that facilitation had a role to play in developing the agenda in the first place. They didn't trust us to help with this in the beginning. But little by little, one even at a time, we started to demonstrate our value and the contribution we could make to process design. After finishing the first official event of the Karen ""Ethnic-based National Dialogue,"" and then carrying on with the National Dialogue, they realized they needed to establish a strong facilitation team. They came to appreciate this form of professional skill, and it was no longer good enough to just randomly call together meetings, as had been their habit. These days they invite us to facilitate even their smaller team meetings, not just the big events. This is how much the culture of the organization has changed - they want us to play a role at every level."
16,Community,Moderate,,Strong,"Power dynamics, Quality discussions","Discussions between the EAO leaders and villagers, when they come together at the village hall, can be awkward affairs. The EAOs are powerful, their leaders sit in front, they give some briefing or even instructions, and the ordinary villagers are intimidated into silence, even when they have a real issue to raise. So we came up with an idea to bring these issues to the surface. We set up some little bowls on tables, one for the KNU, one for the village administrator, etc. And putting a note in the bowl was a way to speak up and give a message to a leader. After lunch we would read these out, and ask the leaders to respond. Some issues could get resolved there on the spot, and some needed time before the leaders could respond, but at least these things were recognized and handled in a way that they wouldn't be before. In one meeting, for example, the community raised the issue of ""taxation."" Taxation in this context means that the EAOs collect money from the communities. The community in this instance thought that the taxation amount was too high, but they were afraid to make this point. So at one meeting our bowls helped them raise this issue. At the meeting were not only low-level officers, but also higher-level officers. At the time the higher level officers said ""Oh, we didn’t know about that, we have a standard rate for that."" So they started an inquiry right there to get to the bottom of it, right in public. They asked the lower level officers to clarify. In the end it was agreed that villagers should keep receipts as evidence, and complaints could be submitted to the head office. This new way of handling complaints was a constructive outcome of one of our facilitated meetings."
17,"Family, Community",Moderate,,Strong,"Maturity, empathy","One day, a mother of a student came to me and said, “Teacher I feel so ashamed of myself.” I asked her why. She said that a neighbor had called on the phone to ask to borrow her car. After the call she complained aloud, “They should come in person instead of just calling. Who do they think they are?” The son saw that his mother was angry and suggested: “Put yourself in their place. They could be very busy. Their father might be packing. Their mother could have a stomachache. Even their grandmother could be busy. You don’t need to assume the worst, and be angry. Be kind.” The mother immediately felt shamed by her son's example."
18,"Personal, Colleagues",Moderate,,Moderate,"self-control, self-awareness, blaming others, appreciation, organizational behavior","I used to be very critical in my work, always finding fault with others, but not able to see myself clearly. From PLD I learned how to have self-awareness and self-control. I've also learned the value of showing my appreciation to my colleagues. I have become more thoughtful about how to confront them when necessary. For example, when they make a mistake I do not correct them in front of the group, but instead take time to discuss it with them privately. But when I want to compliment them I make a point of doing that in front of everyone. I see that creates more trust and creates positive energy. Now that I am aware that leading myself is very important, my work life has much improved."
19,Colleagues,Moderate,,Moderate,"organizational behavior, blaming others, listening, quality discussion, collaboration","It used to be that when we had meetings in my religious association, more often than not we would finish with angry arguments. Our discussions got us nowhere. But now we listen to each other more, and the meetings are actually productive. There are many departments in our association, and they used to compete with one another, even attacking and blaming other departments. But now we find ways to support each other and focus on how we can help each other. I've never seen it like this before. "
20,"Personal, Community",Moderate,,Moderate,"tolerance, inclusion, listening","Before I participated in the PLD process, I used to look down on other cultures and religions. I always felt that my religion is the best one, and never even bothered to try to understand other religions and cultures. But now I'm more open to learning and understanding other religions. That’s why I started reading the Bible, as well as celebrating Hindu practices with my Hindu friends. I realized through more engagement that their practices and religious teachings are also very good ways of living."
21,"Personal, Family",Moderate,,Moderate,"empathy, blaming others, gender roles, repair relationships","My wife and I used to live in my family house with the rest of my family members. My wife was unhappy in this situation, but I didn't realize it at the time. I would just complain about her attitude. But during the first PLD process I started to reflect on the situation, was forced to recognize the rift between us and where it was coming from. So I started to try to work on our relationship, paid more attention to her and tried to do more to take care of her. She saw this change in me, saw that PLD had something to do with it, and now she encourages me to keep on with the PLD group. "
22,Colleagues,Moderate,,Moderate,"courage, leadership, organizational behavior, defeatist thinking","I think my biggest lesson from the PLD process is how to deal with worry. At one point when one of our projects ended we had no salary for any of the staff, while I also needed to find a better office space. Instead of giving up or feeling overwhelmed, I simply asked the landlord if we could postpone our rent payments until we got our projects sorted out. He agreed, and we moved forward. Our youth centre will now face a similar financial situation in June, but again my main focus is on how to build our capacities, not what we lack. Before the PLD process I limited myself by always focusing on what I didn’t have. ‘I have no money, I am not good at speaking, there is no one to support me.’ By refusing to put limits on what I can achieve, I was able to start the youth centre and keep it going."
23,"Personal, community",Moderate,,Moderate,"self-awareness, tolerance, inclusion, listening","Before the PLD process I never did any sort of personal reflection, and didn't even listen much to others. After the PLD process I feel I'm doing more of this. Last week on the bus from Lashio to Ygn, for example, there was an Indian guy sitting all by himself. He was shaved bald, he looked dirty and unkempt, and I usually steer clear of such people. But against my inclinations, I decided to make an effort to talk to him this time. He happily shared his story with me, saying that he is going to his brother's funeral, and it's tradition to shave one's head in that case. He also told me about how he's been able to support his whole family with a humble mobile cart business, and this impressed me. He also talked a lot about how he wants to be a good father to his children, which I admired. It changed my whole attitude about him, and made me think about how I judge people by their appearances."
24,"Personal, Family",Moderate,,Moderate,"power dynamics, listening","In the past we never had any regular family dialogue. We only talked when we had some big problem to deal with. But now I create more space for discussion with my family members; we care and share feelings more. Before I just neglected this. My brother once told me he wanted to build out a fish pond for a small business and I neglected it because I thought it wouldn’t work. But I later came to support his idea, and now I try to listen to him more. Before I used to think that only one person needs to make a decision. But now I understand how important it is for everyone in the family to have a voice in the decision, and we're trying to act this way."
25,"Personal, Colleagues",Moderate,,Moderate,"Self-control, organizational behavior, listening, quality discussion, inclusion","Before PLD, when we had meetings in our organizations we discussed based on emotions alone. After PLD, I can manage myself better, and I can better understand how other people think and feel the way they do. And I can find better ways to resolve our discussions. Before our discussions were rather short - we vented our feelings, and there wasn't any space to work things through. The attitude was 'take it or leave it.' Now our discussions are long. We take time to understand the motivations on all sides, their concerns, etc."
26,Community,Moderate,,Moderate,"Community organizing, listening, inclusion","One of my main achievements has been facilitating and organizing meetings within my own tribal community. We have six different families within this community. Most of them have moved away from the region for their career/business. Yet we all still dreamed to stay close together in the same town or close by. Thanks to DF, I decided to make a plan to bring the community closer again - I designed and strategized a process, a long process. I called each family frequently to explain and also let my parents talk to each respective parent. I organized a community gathering around in order to have a dialogue about our desires to be closer, in which I facilitated a decision-making process. I shared my difficulties and gave time to listen all of the families and facilitated part of the dialogue through a narrative practice, which included a timeline of tribal history in my community. As a result, four of the tribal families are living in same town and the other two will move closer to us in the near future."
27,Family,Moderate,,Moderate,"Courage, Questioning authority, Maturity","The differences between children from government school and community school are visible only within the family. I see children from government schools just do what they are told. But my daughter in the community school is always asking ""Why?"" She wants to understand, not just follow orders. One specific example is that my daughter got involved one day when I was working with a friend on how to build out the sewer drain that runs from my house to the street. The daughter spoke up to point out that this sort of construction really needed to involve an expert who knows the city system, and it's not just something for people to try and do for themselves in a haphazard way. She urged me to take my plans to a responsible person, and she was right."
28,Family,Moderate,,Moderate,"Maturity, empathy","My sister-in-law is an ECCD head teacher. She has always known a lot of things, but that knowledge didn't change her as a person. Now she finds that she is being changed by her child. For example, one day I brought some clothes for the poor in the hills, and told my sister and niece they could take one if they found something they needed. My niece had already chosen an item she liked. But because the clothes were very nice, her mother wanted to take more than one. She wanted to exchange some of her old clothes for the newer ones that were meant for the poor. My niece objected, and told her mother she shouldn't do that. In the end the mother relented, and said, “I’ve learned from my daughter.”"
29,"Personal, Family",Deep,,Strong,"courage, social pressure, self-control, self-direction","My wife, my two sons and I used to live in my family house with the rest of my family members. In 2017 my father made a decision about something that turned the family against him. It got so bad that they forced him out of the house, and his health situation worsened. Even my elder brother, an influential religious leader in the region, treated him very badly. I was the only one who defended him, even though I too deeply disagreed with his decision.  Eventually I decided to move out to a different house and take my father with me. Before attending the PLD workshops I would say I was indecisive, but PLD started to show me how to find my own direction and make difficult choices. I saw this in action in my family situation: I was able to control myself, make deliberate choices, and move toward the most positive outcome. It was not easy, but I was able to do what I needed to."
30,"Personal, Community",Deep,,Strong,"courage, self-awareness, self-direction, social pressure, social work, support network","I was born in Myanmar, but moved to Thailand as a child, and so never learned Burmese very well. After I got married my husband and I decided to move back to Myanmar. Toward the end of 2015 I was invited to join this PLD workshop. At the time I was not clear about what I really wanted to do with my life. I had lots of dreams but had a hard time settling on just one. PLD helped me really focus on the question of what I really wanted to do with my life. I realized that I wanted to work to help poor women and children in Myanmar get an education. I went back and told my relatives about this, and they tried to discourage the idea, saying, “Impossible! You can’t even speak or write Burmese!” But PLD encouraged me to believe that it would not be impossible if I committed myself to my dream.  Actually I didn't really know how to start, but I made a simple start by supporting 6 children whose families couldn't afford to send them to school. We moved back to Kyeng Tung, and rented a place there in the middle of town to house the children. That was 3 years ago. Now we've moved to a larger compound outside of town, we now have 18 children, with plans to expand to include a retreat center and other sustainable agricultural projects that can help the poor village families the children come from. I couldn't have done it alone. I also got help from 4 other people who were in our PLD support group, as they took on leadership roles. Together we found the new space, got funding for the construction, and negotiated a formal relationship with a local church association so that we could be officially registered for social work, and do all that without having them change our vison or program. I used to worry too much about other people's opinions, and this held me back from doing what I really wanted to do. I had lots of fear. But now I find I can take initiative, and that's been the biggest change for me.  "
31,"Personal, Family",Deep,,Strong,"self-awareness, self-control, blaming others, repairing relationships ","In 2011, when I was 18, my mother and father died within 40 days of each other. It was left to me to take care of my two teenage sisters. We were living together with some of our other relatives at the time, but they didn’t like us. The relationship between my aunt and I was especially bad. There was one day when she gave me money for some purpose, and I simply rejected it: I wanted nothing from her. We just stopped talking after that, even though we continued to live in the same household. I always blamed others for my pain back then. My perspective was totally changed in the 2016 PLD TOT process. I started to accept my parents’ death and saw my life very differently – maybe even as an opportunity for growth. In 2016, on Mother’s Day, I resolved to change my attitude towards my aunt. I gave her a present with no expectation. I told her “Thank you aunty and I love you.” Instead of receiving it as I intended, she made a joke about the gift, I think because she just didn't trust my intentions. Change didn’t happen between us right away. One day in 2017 my mother’s relatives came to visit us. I didn’t expect that good things would come from this trip, as they had bad relations with my aunt. But I was surprised to see how helpful my aunt became during their visit. She took care of everything they needed willingly. I never saw my aunt behave like that before. I started to see that as I'd been working on improving my relationship with her, little by little she'd also softened in her approach to me. I saw that it was possible to rebuild trust. I know that without this PLD process I wouldn't have been able to make this change."
32,Personal,Deep,,Strong,"self-direction, self-awareness, organizational behavior, questioning authority, inclusion","My organization’s policy doesn’t allow us to go and train up other groups when we are invited individually. We can participate with other organisational activities, but we’re not allowed to lead. Kanlet invited us to participate in a ‘Rumour Management’ workshop. After their process, they selected me as a trainer out of 47 participants. My organisation told me I wouldn't be allowed to take this on. Without PLD, I would have just accepted my organisation’s decision without challenging it. But through PLD I have learned that ‘If you really want something, you will find a way. If you don’t, you’ll find an excuse.’ I reflected and asked myself: ‘Why am I doing development work? For my organisation or for the community?’ I resolved to be a trainer despite my organization's objections, taking personal leave in order to get it done. As a trainer we have to do five trainings, now I’ve already done four and next week I will do the last one."
33,Personal,Deep,,Strong,"Self-direction, courage, listening","The biggest change in my life following DF has been that I've made a major career change, and I credit DF with enabling me to do this. I had been appointed as a school teacher, which my family forced me to accept at the time, since they thought government service was a good and stable situation. My parents in particular twisted my arm. I went along with it, since I do like children, but at the same time some part of me felt that teaching was too limiting. After doing the DF program I felt that I had found my calling. I think the thing I find most compelling about it is that when I facilitate I'm not teaching people, not trying to instruct them. Instead I'm listening and learning from them, and we come together in that way. So after this I felt emboldened to make my own choice, despite strong pressure from my family, and chose to leave my teaching appointment and take a risk on making facilitation my career."
34,Community,Deep,,Strong,"Empathy, Flexibility","In our school there is a special student who has a lot of consideration for others. One day a student got sick. I thought I would take the whole class to visit him when school let out. But we were busy that day, and so couldn't make time for it. But that child went by himself. The following morning, he stood up and said, “Teacher, I want to say something.” He reported that our sick classmate looked very lonely. He said, “If we visit him he'll feel better, and that will speed his recovery.” I replied that the whole class would visit him end of the day. But the student insisted, “Why can’t we go now in the morning? We can have our class as a discussion while we're walking.” Then I thought, “Why not?”. And so we visited the sick boy in the morning. He was very happy. The following day he rejoined the class."
35,"Colleagues, Community",Deep,,Strong,"Courage, Questioning authority, Power dynamics","I was always a good follower; always listening to the leaders. I am an assistant principal now, which has put me in an uncomfortable position of being a leader. Last December, for example, the teachers and students wanted to have a Christmas gathering with another community school, and we started to make plans with this other school. Our school principal wasn’t present at that time, so it fell to me to go inform the school committee. The reply I got from the school committee was, ""This is not your school. You don't just get to decide these things on your own. You should have come to us first."" Within the church culture, sending an official letter from the church if having activities with another church is the protocol, but from my perspective this was not a church activity. I felt I was being scolded unjustly. The other teachers were about to just give in, but when I looked at the very excited students, and all the preparation work we were doing, like making presents and decorations, I decided to not back down. I went back to the school committee and confronted them, ""This is not a church activity. This is our school activity. It's even in the curriculum. Even if you don't approve, we are going.” In the end the school committee relented, but warned me not to do things like this again."
36,"Personal, Family",Deep,,Moderate,"Self-awareness, Self-control, violence, empathy","I had a terrible relationship with my mother in law for the longest time. My own parents passed away earlier, and so my husband and I lived with my mother-in-law. She would complain about me or do things to question or undermine me, and I would often lose my temper. In fact, there were even times when I beat her physically. I think I even had a reputation in our neighborhood for being a bad daughter-in-law. It was obvious to everyone. But after the DF training, I think my mind opened a little bit to seeing her perspective, and I started to recognize how her motivation really came from a place of love and concern for her son, not really hostility to me. Change hasn't happened quickly - it's been 2 years that I've been trying to change my behavior at home - but I think we now appreciate each other, and I no longer lose my temper with her."
37,Colleagues,Deep,,Moderate,"Blaming others, self-direction","The very first year of teaching. I worked closely with two other friends. We were very happy, because the students were still very young and very obedient, and we also were still very fresh and idealistic, dreaming that we would make a big breakthrough as a people. We worked through the night together, without feeling tired. We would have to make stories, draw pictures, but were happy and excited for the students and what we were doing for them. But after that time, not so much. Now, in fact, when I come to teacher training I get discouraged. I see our leaders gossiping about each other, complaining that they don't get paid as much as others even though they do more work, and things like that. The idealism is gone."
