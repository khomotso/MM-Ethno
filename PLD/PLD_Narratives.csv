,PLD1,Q2 2018,Direct,"Personal, Family",Story ,,,Strong,"courage, social pressure, self-control, self-direction","My wife, my two sons and I used to live in my family house with the rest of my family members. In 2017 my father made a decision about something that turned the family against him. It got so bad that they forced him out of the house, and his health situation worsened. Even my elder brother, an influential religious leader in the region, treated him very badly. I was the only one who defended him, even though I too deeply disagreed with his decision.  Eventually I decided to move out to a different house and take my father with me. Before attending the PLD workshops I would say I was indecisive, but PLD started to show me how to find my own direction and make difficult choices. I saw this in action in my family situation: I was able to control myself, make deliberate choices, and move toward the most positive outcome. It was not easy, but I was able to do what I needed to."
,PLD1,Q2 2018,Direct,"Personal, Family",Story ,,,Moderate,"empathy, blaming others, gender roles, repair relationships","My wife, my two sons and I used to live in my family house with the rest of my family members. My wife was unhappy in this situation, but I didn't realize it at the time. I would just complain about her attitude. But during the first PLD process I started to reflect on the situation, was forced to recognize the rift between us and where it was coming from. So I started to try to work on our relationship, paid more attention to her and tried to do more to take care of her. She saw this change in me, saw that PLD had something to do with it, and now she encourages me to keep on with the PLD group. "
,PLD1,Q2 2018,Direct,"Personal, Family",Scenario ,,,Weak,controlling others,"I used to try to control my son's life, and steer him toward making the decisions I wanted him to make. Now I am trying to support his choices rather than directing them."
,PLD1,Q2 2018,Direct,Personal,Scenario ,,,Weak,"tolerance, self-direction","I used to be very reactive, very quick to respond when I saw things that I didn’t like. But I'm not so quick to judge now. I am much more open to accepting differences. I feel more peaceful as a result. At the same time I am also more confident to say no when the situation calls for it. "
,PLD2,Q2 2018,Direct,"Personal, Colleagues",Scenario ,,,Weak,"leadership, controlling others, listening, organizational behavior","Before the PLD work I used to be preoccupied with status and power. As a religious leader in my association I used my power in a top-down way, and had no interest in listening to my subordinates. No longer. I feel I have a strong relationship with my colleagues now. I listen more and try to understand other points of view. One of my biggest realizations in PLD was how people create problems by trying to control others. Now I've learned to focus on changing myself first.  My leadership style has changed from top-down to bottom up. Which means I listen more, and I encourage my fellow church village members to find their own voice. With all these changes to how I approach the people around me, I find that I am more content and stress free."
,PLD3,Q2 2018,Direct,"Personal, Colleagues",Scenario ,,,Moderate,"self-control, self-awareness, blame, appreciation/gratitude, organizational behavior","I used to be very critical in my work, always finding fault with others, but not able to see myself clearly. From PLD I learned how to have self-awareness and self-control. I've also learned the value of showing my appreciation to my colleagues. I have become more thoughtful about how to confront them when necessary. For example, when they make a mistake I do not correct them in front of the group, but instead take time to discuss it with them privately. But when I want to compliment them I make a point of doing that in front of everyone. I see that creates more trust and creates positive energy. Now that I am aware that leading myself is very important, my work life has much improved."
,PLD3,Q2 2018,Direct,"Personal, Family",Scenario ,,,Moderate,"patriarchy, showing appreciation, listening, dialogue, building trust","I used to be impatient with my family members. I used to dominate everything as the leading man of the household, and think that was my proper role. But now I think I show my appreciation to my wife and my kids. It seems to me that the trust between us is growing. I believe this because I can see that we are taking more time to talk about things and consult each other, rather than having them hide their opinions because they're afraid of being criticized. We simply never took this kind of discussion time in my family before."
,PLD4,Q2 2018,Direct,"Personal, Family",Scenario ,,,Weak,controlling others,In my family I used to be domineering. I just wanted everyone to follow my instructions. But now it has changed. I am encouraging my family to make their own choices. 
,PLD4,Q2 2018,Direct,"Personal, Colleagues",Scenario ,,,Weak,"blame, forgiveness",I used to be vindictive at work. I would hold grudges and take opportunities to pay people back who I thought had wronged me. But now I find that my desire for revenge has faded. I feel I can put down my bitterness and let go of my ego.
,PLD5,Q2 2018,Direct,Personal,Scenario ,,,Weak,"self-awareness, self-direction","In the beginning I did not think this PLD process would offer any answers. I had attended many trainings and workshops in other settings, and I thought PLD would be just like that. But this PLD work was a very new experience. It showed me how to understand and accept myself. I used to be very negative, and focused on other people's opinions of me, but now I'm able to focus on my own choices for what I want to do with my life. "
,PLD5,Q2 2018,Direct,Personal,Scenario ,,,Weak,"questioning authority, self-awareness","PLD helped me realize that the messages we religious leaders delivered in our sermons were hollow, that in a way we were cheating our church members because we couldn't practice what we preach. For example we teach about love and forgiveness but we can’t even show love in our families or work settings. Sometimes we teach about the kingdom of God, but we don’t even have a clear concept of it. So it's forced me to confront deep and important questions about what I'm doing with my life."
,PLD5,Q2 2018,Direct,Colleagues,Scenario ,,,Moderate,"organizational behavior, blame, listening, dialogue","It used to be that when we had meetings in my religious association, more often than not we would finish with angry arguments. Our discussions got us nowhere. But now we listen to each other more, and the meetings are actually productive. There are many departments in our association, and they used to compete with one another, even attacking and blaming other departments. But now we find ways to support each other and focus on how we can help each other. I've never seen it like this before. "
,PLD5,Q2 2018,Direct,"Personal, Family",Scenario ,,,Moderate,"patriarchy, violence","I used to want my wife to behave like a pastor’s wife. I used to believe that because I am a man she has to obey me. At times I would even get violent when we quarreled. But no longer, and I no longer insist that she behave as I think a pastor's wife should - I just try to understand her better. I think the PLD process helped me change in this way.  "
,PLD6,Q2 2018,Direct,"Personal, Community",Story ,,,Strong,"courage, taking initiative, self-awareness, self-direction, social pressure, social work, group support","I was born in Myanmar, but moved to Thailand as a child, and so never learned Burmese very well. After I got married my husband and I decided to move back to Myanmar. Toward the end of 2015 I was invited to join this PLD workshop. At the time I was not clear about what I really wanted to do with my life. I had lots of dreams but had a hard time settling on just one. PLD helped me really focus on the question of what I really wanted to do with my life. I realized that I wanted to work to help poor women and children in Myanmar get an education. I went back and told my relatives about this, and they tried to discourage the idea, saying, “Impossible! You can’t even speak or write Burmese!” But PLD encouraged me to believe that it would not be impossible if I committed myself to my dream.  Actually I didn't really know how to start, but I made a simple start by supporting 6 children whose families couldn't afford to send them to school. We moved back to Kyeng Tung, and rented a place there in the middle of town to house the children. That was 3 years ago. Now we've moved to a larger compound outside of town, we now have 18 children, with plans to expand to include a retreat center and other sustainable agricultural projects that can help the poor village families the children come from. I couldn't have done it alone. I also got help from 4 other people who were in our PLD support group, as they took on leadership roles. Together we found the new space, got funding for the construction, and negotiated a formal relationship with a local church association so that we could be officially registered for social work, and do all that without having them change our vison or program. I used to worry too much about other people's opinions, and this held me back from doing what I really wanted to do. I had lots of fear. But now I find I can take initiative, and that's been the biggest change for me.  "
,PLD7,Q2 2018,Direct,"Personal, Family, Community",Story ,,,Strong,"courage, self-direction, social work, social pressure, taking initiative, defeatist thinking","Around the time when I first attended the PLD training, my parents were pressuring me to go abroad and work for a company to earn money after university, and to be a businessman. That was their dream. They had supported me in school, which was very expensive for them, and they wanted to get their money back. But I didn't enjoy what I was studying, and this goal did not make me happy. During the first PLD training I actually started crying about my life as I reflected on this, about how my parents were making all the choices for my life. So I made a decision while I was at the training, and after graduation I resolved to get into social work. Before the PLD process I limited myself by always focusing on what I didn’t have: ‘I have no money, I am not good at speaking, there is no one to support me,’ but I refused to let that stop me this time. I went back and started a blood donation group in my village. After doing this for a little while, and getting involved in more villages in the shadow state, we realized we needed to set up an organization. And we could also see that the needs in the shadow state were very great. Around this same time the American embassy came to the area and were giving small grants for development work. We submitted a proposal to them about landmine education, and that was accepted. Then our CSO grew from there. I started the centre without any money or previous experience, and my parents thought it was useless. I had a job but no salary. PLD helped build my confidence and motivated me to start doing this. Before I started the centre, my parents would usually order me around all the time. But now they don’t order me about or pressure me to do anything."
,PLD7,Q2 2018,Direct,"Personal, Community",Scenario ,,,Moderate,"tolerance, inclusion, listening","Before I participated in the PLD process, I used to look down on other cultures and religions. I always felt that my religion (Buddhism) is the best one, and never even bothered to try to understand other religions and cultures. But now I'm more open to learning and understanding other religions. That’s why I started reading the Bible, as well as celebrating Hindu practices with my Hindu friends. I realized through more engagement that their practices and religious teachings are also very good ways of living."
,PLD7,October 2018,Direct,Personal,Story,,,Strong,"organizational behavior, power sharing, listening, anxiety, group support","We use many ideas from PLD in the organization I started. The main one is that all of the staff work in what I call a family style. When we make decisions in the CYC we make a point of listening to one another before we make decisions. I have also made a second-leader for the organization, so that we share responsibility and everything doesn't depend on just one person. We are not focused on the pressure of the work, we are focused on each other. For example, the main donor for our CSO once told us that the second round of funding would be delayed, maybe up to 6 months. So we had no money to support the staff, or the project beneficiaries. I went to visit other CSOs to try to get help, but they couldn't offer any help. But instead of letting it overwhelm me, I simply asked the landlord if we could postpone our rent payments until we got our projects sorted out, and I just focused on taking care of my team during the period with no funding. Then after that 6-month gap in funding we were able to pick up and carry on. The main lesson I took from that was to stop worrying, and just focus on the people around me."
,PLD8,Q2 2018,Direct,Personal,Story ,,,Weak,"self-direction, social pressure, gratitude","I used to be very sensitive and insecure about what other people thought, but with PLD I’ve been able to change this. I’m more in control of my own choices and don’t think about having to prove myself to others all the time. It's been so transformative for me that I've been keen to share this with others, and in fact I've developed a bit of a reputation in the community for it. When people see me these days, they joke ‘Oh, PLD is coming.’ This annoyed me at first, but now I've come to take it in stride. I focus much more on gratitude now; the more I do this, the more I seem to receive gratitude. "
,PLD8,Q2 2018,Direct,Personal,Story ,,,Strong,"self-direction, social pressure, courage, taking initiative","Thanks to PLD I feel stronger and more confident in my decision-making. To give just one example, I was able to build a two-story mud house for my family. Before I started this house all of my family members told me: ‘It is not possible. You have no building experience and you have no money.’ Other people in the neighborhood also made comments like this. I didn’t listen to them. Now we have a house where we regularly host visitors."
,PLD8,Q2 2018,Direct,Personal,Story ,,,Strong,"self-direction, social pressure, courage, self-awareness","I used to work for a religious organization, but over time came to realize that this work was not compatible with my dreams. They told me I was selfish for wanting to leave, which stopped me from making this decision initially. But eventually I mustered the courage to follow my passions, and resigned my position so that I could pursue my own projects. I want to be involved in this transformation process for my whole life: it keeps me motivated, has allowed me to heal from issues that are causing me pain, and enables me to lead a peaceful and meaningful life. "
,PLD9,Q2 2018,Direct,Family,Story ,,,Weak,"listening, patriarchy, self-awareness, repairing relationships","I never had regular contact with my family when I was at University. We’d talk maybe once a year, and only when I needed money. I followed the same pattern after I got married. I didn’t contact my wife and children very often, which is why my relationship with them hasn’t been good. My children and I hardly talked. I’m a leader of an association, often very busy, and so when my wife called I would often be short-tempered with her. During the transformation workshop I realized that I had to change. From then on, I started to try to reach out more, and call my family regularly. I also decided that no matter how busy I am, I will put effort into my family relationships."
,PLD10,Q2 2018,Direct,"Personal, Family",Scenario ,,,Moderate,"patriarchy, breaking convention","I’m a very busy religious leader. I usually think that I'm working harder than everyone else. I never used to help my wife around the house because I always thought that's her duty. But after attending the transformation process, I started to rethink this, and have now begun to cook and wash clothes or dishes. It makes me feel happier sharing the workload with my family. "
,PLD10,Q2 2018,Direct,Personal,Story ,,,Moderate,starting small,"I’ve always been ambitious, but this has usually meant going for big things, like starting a whole new business. From PLD I have learned the importance of seeing the small things too, and making simple starts. I'm selling organic rice, for example, and that's going well, but I didn't need to try to create a whole new shop or make a big deal out of it - I'm just making a simple start by selling it from my home."
,PLD11,Q2 2018,Direct,"Personal, Family",Story ,,,Strong,"self-direction, repairing relationships, courage","I’ve never been confident enough to make difficult decisions, and lacked the motivation to follow them through. But in 2016, I decided to leave my religious organisation. Without the transformation process, I couldn’t have made that decision.  I knew I needed more time to rebuild my relationship in my family (especially my mother), while at the same time I’ve always been interested in working on women’s issues, and my religious organization wasn't allowing enough room for me to make progress in either area. "
,PLD11,Q2 2018,Direct,"Personal, Community",Scenario ,,,Weak,"listening, violence, women's issues","I've always worked with women's issues, but I used to have a hard time listening to or knowing how to deal with stories of gender-based violence. I feel that now I approach these issues in a much more transformative way, for now I have more strength and energy and I can help to empower those women."
,PLD12,Q2 2018,Direct,Family,Scenario ,,,Weak,"dialogue, self-awareness","I used to always think I was right, especially with my family. I would demand that all my family members accept and follow my ideas. Through this transformation process I now feel I am more aware that I need to do more family dialogue, and I am doing it."
,PLD13,Q2 2018,Direct,Personal,Scenario ,,,Moderate,"courage, questioning authority","I am much stronger than I was before. As the head of the women’s department of a religious organisation, now when I see injustice in my organization I feel confident enough to express my voice strongly. When some of the senior members told me that I was causing trouble, it didn’t shake my confidence. This is what I have learned from the transformation process."
,PLD14,Q2 2018,Direct,"Personal, Family",Story ,,,Strong,"self-awareness, self-control, blaming others, repairing relationships ","In 2011, when I was 18, my mother and father died within 40 days of each other. It was left to me to take care of my two teenage sisters. We were living together with some of our other relatives at the time, but they didn’t like us. The relationship between my aunt and I was especially bad. There was one day when she gave me money for some purpose, and I simply rejected it: I wanted nothing from her. We just stopped talking after that, even though we continued to live in the same household. I always blamed others for my pain back then. My perspective was totally changed in the 2016 PLD TOT process. I started to accept my parents’ death and saw my life very differently – maybe even as an opportunity for growth. In 2016, on Mother’s Day, I resolved to change my attitude towards my aunt. I gave her a present with no expectation. I told her “Thank you aunty and I love you.” Instead of receiving it as I intended, she made a joke about the gift, I think because she just didn't trust my intentions. Change didn’t happen between us right away. One day in 2017 my mother’s relatives came to visit us. I didn’t expect that good things would come from this trip, as they had bad relations with my aunt. But I was surprised to see how helpful my aunt became during their visit. She took care of everything they needed willingly. I never saw my aunt behave like that before. I started to see that as I'd been working on improving my relationship with her, little by little she'd also softened in her approach to me. I saw that it was possible to rebuild trust. I know that without this PLD process I wouldn't have been able to make this change."
,PLD14,Q2 2018,Direct,"Personal, Community",Story ,,,Moderate,"self-awareness, self-control, repairing relationships","After my parents' death the members of the church showed me a lot of sympathy, but to an excessive degree, I felt, to the point that I started to resent the way their pity made me feel, like a victim. But after the second PLD process I reflected and asked myself why I’ve been allowing their actions to make me feel victimised. I learned that I can’t change their attitude, but I can change mine. So I started to try to go to church and look past the behavior that had been wounding me. After a time I could see their own behavior start to change, as I showed a new attitude, and now I feel I have become one of the most reliable young people in my church. Now I have a very good relationship with leaders and youths of church."
,PLD14,Q2 2018,Direct,"Personal, Colleagues",Story ,,,Strong,"repairing relationships, self-direction, ethnic assumptions, dialogue","I once went to a Wa village to deliver seven days of training. My senior colleague told me he’d arrive the following day, but he didn't show up, and I had to start the training without him. I became ill, and as the village is in a remote area and is very poor; they only eat rice balls with no curry. My sickness grew and as the food was terrible, I had no energy and I wanted to give up. I decided during the training that I’d make a complaint to my colleague and then quit my job. Finally he arrived on the last day but I didn’t talk to him - instead the villagers told him about my struggles. On the drive back home I asked myself “what would be the use of complaining?” But I decided to talk with him frankly about how the situation affected me, without coming across as blaming. He then acknowledged the lack of conscientiousness he’d shown, and we were able to build an understanding through this conversation, which encouraged me to stay on. Now we are happily working together and he has learnt from his mistakes. I never used to be confident enough to express my ideas and take decisions."
,PLD14,Q2 2018,Direct,Personal,Story ,,,Strong,"self-awareness, self-direction, organizational behavior, challenging authority, breaking convention","My organization’s policy doesn’t allow us to go and train up other groups when we are invited individually. We can participate with other organisational activities, but we’re not allowed to lead. Kanlet invited us to participate in a ‘Rumour Management’ workshop. After their process, they selected me as a trainer out of 47 participants. My organisation said ‘no’ you are not allowed to this. Without PLD, I would have just accepted my organisation’s decision. But through PLD I have learned that ‘If you really want something, you will find a way. If you don’t, you’ll find an excuse.’ I reflected and asked myself: ‘Why am I doing development work? For my organisation or for the community?’ I made a choice to get involved in the Rumour Management program as a trainer. I took my personal leave in order to do this Rumour Management training. Now I’ve already done four of these, and next week I will do the last one. "
,PLD14,Q2 2018,Direct,"Personal, Colleagues",Scenario ,,,Moderate,"self-control, organizational behavior","In my organization there are many senior people who have had the PLD process before. When I compare between those who took PLD and those who didn’t in my office, the people who did are less reactive and they can maintain strong relationships in difficult situations. That’s why whenever we recruit new people, we put some of the PLD concepts in orientation. We are still discussing how to put in some PLD process work for all our staff."
,PLD15,August 2018,Direct,"Community, Colleagues",Story ,,,Moderate,"organizational behavior, dialogue","There was a recent time when the government, working with some Chinese businesses, tried to take over some of the land vacated by IDPs in order to set up a banana plantation. The church association I lead had to work to try to mobilize the people to resist this, but do so with a community obviously distributed widely and under threat, and yet without things spilling over into yet another episode of hostilities. My staff had to do a lot of work to organize people, and I think some of the communication skill we learned through PLD helped us manage this in a way that I think we simply couldn't have 2 years ago."
,PLD16,July 2018,Direct,Family,Story ,,,Strong,"violence, self-awareness, self-control","In 2014 I attended my first PLD during a summer education camp. I thought that PLD would have something to do with management, and I was wrong, but wanted to learn more. Although the ideas were appealing, I didn't really try to apply it in my life until I fell into a conflict with my stepmother over an inheritance. There was a moment when I even contemplated having my stepmother killed, I was so consumed with the desire to win. But then I started to recognize how my ego was in the driver's seat. It came to the point where I was faced with a choice of giving false testimony in court, and that's when I finally realized that my path did not align with my values. I changed course, didn't take that step of lying in court, and my stepmother won the case. I can't claim that we have a good relationship now, but I take some satisfaction from the fact that I controlled myself at the end."
,PLD16,July 2018,Direct,"Personal, community",Story ,,,Strong,"self-awareness, tolerance, inclusion, listening","Before the PLD process I never did any sort of personal reflection, and didn't even listen much to others. But now I feel I'm doing more of this. Last week on the bus from Lashio to Ygn, for example, there was an Indian guy sitting all by himself. He was shaved bald, and he looked dirty and unkempt. I'm usually careful about my appearance, and so tend to steer clear of such people, but I decided that this time I would make an effort to talk to this man, against my inclinations. He happily shared his story with me, saying that he is going to his brother's funeral, and it's tradition to shave one's head for that. He also told me about how he has managed to support his entire family from just a humble mobile cart business, and I was impressed with how much he has been able to do with so little. He also talked about how important his family was, and how he wants to be a good father to his children. It changed my whole attitude about him, and about how I judge people from their appearance."
,PLD17,July 2018,Direct,"Personal, Family",Story ,,,Moderate,"patriarchy, listening, dialogue","In the past we never had any regular family dialogue. We only talked when we had some big problem to deal with. But now I create more space for discussion with my family members; we care and share feelings more. Before I just neglected this. My brother once told me he wanted to build out a fish pond for a small business and I neglected it because I thought it wouldn’t work. But I later came to support his idea, and now I try to listen to him more. Before I used to think that only one person needs to make a decision. But now I understand how important it is for everyone in the family to have a voice in the decision, and we're trying to act this way."
,PLD18,July 2018,Direct,Personal,Story ,,,Moderate,"self-awareness, controlling others, despair","In 2016 I attended my first PLD workshop. I went to two of them with the Women, Peace And Security Group. My first experience with PLD actually made me laugh, because it ran counter to everything I thought I knew. For example, I usually want to control others: I expect a lot from them and I want to change them all the time. Which leaves me exhausted and despondent. I found PLD at just the right time, because I had actually begun to contemplate suicide. The PLD work helped bring me out of that low point, and shift my focus."
,PLD18,July 2018,Direct,"Personal, Community",Scenario ,,,Moderate,"violence, self-awareness, self-control, blame, listening","I am very reactive, when I get angry I harm others, and if there is no one nearby I harm myself. But now my colleagues tell me that I've changed a lot, while I feel I am more happy at work. I used to push other people to do what I do. I am a lecturer at the Theological College and youth leader at my church. Youth from my church never participate in church activities. I used to complain and blame them without trying to understand them. Now I go out and talk each of those youths, try to understand where they are coming from, and little by little this has helped them become more active in church social activities. The way I lecture in my class is also changing. I am using now more dialogue way that I never try before. All the students also really seem to love it."
,PLD19,October 2018,Direct,"Personal, Colleagues",Scenario,,,Weak,"rude language, social pressure","The key thing I learned from PLD is that if I want to change something in my life, or in my family, it has to start with me. This is something I apply even in my work. One example is that many of my friends speak rudely, and I don't like that. So I resolved to not talk like that, and now they don't do it around me."
,PLD19,October 2018,Direct,"Personal, Colleagues",Scenario,,,Weak,"enjoying life, accepting the past, defeatist thinking","The overall change for me is that now I'm enjoying my life. I feel content with my work and family relationships. Before I was depressed about my life, and felt unlucky and trapped, because a lot of bad things had happened to me. The PLD process has opened doors onto new ways of seeing my situation, accepting my past rather than resenting it, making new choices for the future to have the life that I want.
"
,PLD20,October 2018,Direct,"Personal, family",scenario,,,Moderate,"learning from children, gratitude","One of the things that's really changed is my relationship with my mom. When I told my mom about some of the things I was learning from PLD, she accepted it and started to try to practice some of those things as well. She even talks about it with other people she meets, people I don't know. Some of these people even come back to me to ask questions, people I've never met before. For example, I told my mom about gratitude in relationships. And my mom has taken this idea to heart, sharing it with other people. Other people marvel that even though she is the mother, she says she has learned from her daughter.
"
,PLD20,October 2018,Direct,"Personal, family",scenario,,,Moderate,"gratitude, breaking convention, organizational behavior","I started my own design business recently, and I've hired two staff. I've brought to this business the lesson about gratitude with my staff. I always thank them for their contribution. At first they found this strange - this is not normal in most businesses in Myanmar. I don't berate them when things go wrong, which is what employees are used to from their bosses, I just try to be clear to explain what I want and need. We have a pretty warm relationship within a short period of time (3 weeks). Now they feel like they own their own work. They actually show up early for work, and they tell me their friends find that strange and ask them why they do that. And they tell them it's because they are happy with their job."
