# Phase I

---

## Phase I Goals
- probe the theory of change
- map the issue space
- infuse with evaluation
-- reorient the organizational culture and practice
-- new dynamic with local partners
- iterate on an analytical framework

## Phase I Non-goals:
- evaluate for accountability
- establish baseline data
- apply quantitative methods (factor analysis, process tracing)

---

## The Interviews
- 95 and counting
- about 170 excerpts mined from these
- going back and retrieving more as perspectives, and not only change narratives

---

## Analytical framework
- chunk interview responses out into narratives
- classify these narratives as stories, scenarios, and perspectives
- code the narratives for social issues they touch upon
- rate them for significance, vertical and horizontal vectors
- reflect this back to change agents in the communities, and seek their feedback/correction

## Lessons learned
- Cultural obstacles: trust, questioning
- added colleagues as a sphere
- added perspectives to stories
- shift the organizational culture toward continuous evaluation rather than one-offs
