## Social spaces are complex adaptive systems
- probe, sense, respond
- methods tuned for emergence

---
 
## Depth as important as Scale

---

## Phase I Goals
- probe, sense
- infuse with evaluation
-- dynamic with local partners
-- organizational culture
- first draft analytical framework

## Phase I Non-goals:
- evaluate for accountability
- establish baseline
- apply quantitative methods (factor analysis, process tracing)

---

## The process:
- Beneficiary interviews
- Case studies of community change
- Chew on it with local partners
- Roll up results for Hope learning and accountability

---

## The Interviews
- 100 and counting
- about 170 excerpts mined for analysis

---

## Analytical framework
- chunk interview responses out into narratives
- classify these narratives as stories, scenarios, and perspectives
- code the narratives for social issues they touch upon
- rate them for significance, vertical and horizontal vectors

---

## Analytical supplements (with partners)
- system maps
- issue spaces

---

## Lessons learned
- Cultural obstacles: questioning, trust
- added colleagues as a sphere
- added perspectives to stories
- vector approach

## Story samples
